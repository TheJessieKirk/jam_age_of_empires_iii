## Units

* **Surgeons** now have British dialogue when controlled by a Chinese or Hindustani (Indian) player, and Dutch dialogue when controlled by a Japanese player.<br>
Britain was among the first civilisations to force open trade with China after the First Opium War (Chinese: 第一次鴉片戰爭) (1839–1842)<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War)]</sup>.<br>
While the Dutch were initially much more prolific in Hindustan via the United East India Company (Dutch: *Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie*)<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company)]</sup>, British colonialism in India is more in keeping with the game's campaign, where the British East India Company are the antagonists.<br>
During Japan's Edo period, the only Europeans permitted to trade with Japan were the Dutch from 1634–1854<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Japan)]</sup>.

* Added **Brig**, a non-Pirate/Privateer version of the Privateer mercenary. American, British, Circle of Ossus, Dutch, French, Hindustani (Indian). John Black's Mercenaries, Knights of St. John, Ottoman, Prussian (German), Portuguese, Russian and Spanish docks can train them.<br>
**Work in Progress: Brig icon is still the Privateer, Brigs don't have random names, and the AI doesn't use them.**

* **Fishing Boats** have visible crews, no longer cost population, and have a build limit of 12.<br>
**Work in Progress: Aztec, Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), Hindustani (Indian) and Sioux fishing boats have glitchy crews.**

* **Irregulars**, **Minutemen**, **Sentries**, and **Warriors** no longer lose health and can be healed.

* Added **Lakota Burnt Thigh**, an effective siege cavalry unit.<br>
One of the nations of the Lakota known for the use of fire in warfare and hunting[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brul%C3%A9).<br>
**Work in Progress: Temporary models, and the AI doesn't use them**

* Changed **Flaming Arrows** to **Ozutsu**, and removed flame from arrows.<br />
Flaming arrows didn't exist; a bronze cannon that fired stone arrows could be called Ozutsu (Japanese: 大筒) <sup>(https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E7%AD%92)</sup>.<br>

* Added **Ishybiya**, a bronze cannon that fires cannonballs. Japanese castles can train them.<br />
Japanese bronze cannon usually fired cannonballs<sup>(https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E7%AD%92)</sup>.<br>

* Added **Sioux Lancers** and removed **Dog Soldiers**. Sioux Lancers are an effective anti-infantry cavalry unit, unlike game-breaking Dog Soldiers.<br>
Dog Soldiers are Cheyenne, not Lakota Sioux<sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Soldiers)</sup>.<br>
**Work in Progress: Temporary models, and the AI doesn't use them**

* Added **Sioux Scout**, a recon unit.<br>
**Work in Progress: Temporary models, and the AI doesn't use them**

## Maps
* Removed references to the Huari from **Andes**.

## Campaign

### Blood, Ice and Steel - Act 1
* You can now build **Galleys** instead of **Caravels**.<br>
The Knights of Saint John, being a Mediterranean civilisation, made extensive use of galleys<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_of_the_Order_of_Saint_John)]</sup>, whereas Caravels were only used by the Portuguese and Spanish<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravel)]</sup>.

* You can now train **Harquebusiers** from your Barracks, and upgrade them to **Veteran Harquebusiers**.<br>
The Knights of Saint John had access to harquebus during the Great Siege of Malta (Maltese: L-Assedju l-Kbir) (1565)<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Siege_of_Malta)]</sup>.<br>
*This is a temporary model and portrait.*

* Your **Surgeons** have Spanish dialogue as opposed to being silent.<br>
While the Knights of Saint John was an international order, only a minority seemed to be English<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller)]</sup>.

* Your **Churches** now appear to be Mediterranean instead of Western European.

* In **Breakout**:
  * The Ottoman player is now Ottoman instead of British.
  * The Ottoman player is now called "Sahin the Falcon" instead of "Ottomans".
  * The allied Knights of Saint John player is now called "Alain Magnan" instead of "Knights of Saint John".
  * The Hussars that arrive to save the fort from the Ottoman artillery are now Guard Hussars, rather than Imperial Hussars (as this would be anachronistic).
  * Removed unnecessary Rebellions from the forbidden technologies list.

* In **Into the Caves**:
  * The Find a Shipwreck objective now clears correctly, and Morgan Black congratulates the player when this is done. 

* In **PIRATES!**:
  * The Caravel that is burnt by a Fire Ship at the start of the scenario is now a Galley.
  * All Caravels that arrive from Malta are now Galleys.
  * One of the deployed armies from Malta now consists of Harquebusiers instead of Hoop Throwers.

### Blood, Ice and Steel - Act 2
* Your **Surgeons** have British dialogue as opposed to being silent.

* Renamed **Black's Mercenaries** to **Massachusetts Bay**.<br>
Stuart Black is the official of Brunswick, which is presumably Brunswick in modern-day Maine<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick%2C_Maine)]</sup>. The town at the time was in the Province of Massachusetts Bay<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay)]</sup>.<br>
John Black's Home City is Boston, Massachusetts<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston)]</sup>, which was the capital of Massachusetts Bay.<br>
After defending Brunswick, Kanyenke states that he and John must return to New England, which was again part of Massachusetts Bay.

* Replaced the **Black's Mercenaries** flag, a fictitious one, with the British Red Ensign.<br>
The Province of Massachusetts Bay flew the British Red Ensign from 1708–1775<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Massachusetts)]</sup>.<br>

* **Stuart Black** now uses a pistol instead of his fists.<br>
Despite his reluctance to fight, Stuart tends to end up charging at his attackers and punching them. I felt a pistol was more appropriate.

* **John Black** no longer makes a sexist comment to **Stuart Black** at the beginning of **Strange Alliances**.

### Blood, Ice and Steel - Act 3
* Your **Surgeons** have American dialogue as opposed to being silent.

* Removed many of the building restrictions from the Knights of St. John in **Blood, Ice and Steel**, mostly restrictions on building walls.

* De-anglicised the Knights of St. John; units now speak more Spanish, churches appear more Mediteranean, and ship names are now real historical Maltese names.

## Sound Effects
* **Replaced blunderbuss shot sounds** with more realistic ones, taken from recordings of a 17th Century blundrrbuss.<br><br>

* **Replaced heavy cannon shot sounds** with more realistic ones, taken from recordings of American Parrott Rifle cannon.<br><br>

* **Replaced musket shot sounds** with more realistic ones, taken from recordings of British Land Pattern Muskets (AKA Brown Bess).<br><br>

## Flags
* **Replaced the Aztec flag**, a fictitious flag, with a Nahuas cultural flag.<br><br>
This flag is anachronistic, but I feel it's more respectful to the Nahaus than a fictitious one.<br><br>

* **Replaced the Chilean flag**, the current national flag, with the national flag of 1818-1854.<br><br>
Supreme Director Bernardo O'Higgins (1778–1842)'s term as leader took place between 1817–1823, making the replacement flag the correct one.<br><br>

<br><br>

* **Replaced the Colombian flag**, an unknown or fictitious flag(?), with the national flag of 1821-1831.<br><br>
President Francisco de Paula Santander (1792–1840)'s term as leader took place between 1819–1826, making the replacement flag the correct one.<br><br>

<br><br>

* **Replaced the Dutch flag**, a double States Flag (Dutch: *Statenvlag*), with the Prince's Flag (Dutch: *Prinsenvlag*).<br><br>
Maurice of Nassau (Dutch: *Maurits van Nassau*) (1567–1625), later Maurice of Orange (Dutch: *Maurits van Oranje*) ruled most of the Netherlands (Dutch: *Nederland*) (r. c. 1585–1618) as Stadtholder, and later as Prince (r. 1618–1625). The Netherlands did not replace its flag with the States Flag until 1652. This makes the use of the States Flag anachronistic.<br><br>

<br><br> 

* **Replaced the French flag**, a banner of the arms of the House of Bourbon (French: *Maison de Bourbon*), with the Tricolour (French: *Drapeau de la France*).<br><br>
Napoleon I (in-game: *Napoleon Bonaparte*, French: *Napoléon I<sup>er</sup>*) (1769–1821) ruled France (French: *France*) (r. 1799–1804) as Premier, and later the French Empire (French: *Empire Français*) (r. 1804–1814, 1815). King Louis XVI (French: *Louis XVI*) (1754–1793) ruled France (r. 1774–1792) before Napoleon I. Louis XVI used the arms of the House of Bourbon, before being deposed during the French Revolution (French: *Révolution française*) (1789–1799), which used the blue, white and red Tricolour from 1794, and during Napoleon's reign. This makes the use of a banner of the arms of the House of Bourbon anachronistic.<br><br>

<br><br>

* **Replaced the German flag**, an Imperial Eagle (German: *Reichsadler*) (associated with the Holy Roman Empire (German: *Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation*) and other German states), with the 1750–1801 State Flag of Prussia (German: *Flagge des Staates Preußen*).<br><br>
King Frederick II (in-game: *Frederick the Great*, German: *Friedrich II.*) (1712–1786) ruled Prussia (German: *Preuße*) (r. 1740–1786). The current banner of arms appears to be of a "generic" German coat of arms, thus anachronistic.<br><br>

<br><br>

* **Replaced the Indian flag**, The banner of Padishah Akbar now has a moss-green field.<br><br>
Padishah Akbar (1542–1605)'s banner was probably moss-green.<br><br>

This flag is anachronistic, but I feel it's more respectful to the Haudenosaunee than a fictitious one.<br><br>

<br><br>

* **Replaced the Japanese flag**, The banner of Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu (Japanese: 徳川家康), with the Rising Sun flag (Japanese: 日本の国旗)<br><br>
While the banner of Tokugawa isn't really wrong, the use of the Rising Sun flag dates back centuries in Japan as a universal naval ensign.<br><br>

<br><br>

* **Replaced the Ottoman flag**, the 1844–1922 flag of the Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Turkish: *دولت عليه عثمانیه*), with a flag taken from 15th century period artwork and descriptions.<br><br>
Suleiman I (in-game: *Suleiman the Magnificent*, Ottoman Turkish: *سليمان اول*) (1494–1566) ruled the Ottoman Empire (r. *1474–1475*). This makes the use of the 1844–1922 flag of the Ottoman Empire anachronistic.<br><br>

<br><br>

* **Replaced the Portuguese flag**, a banner of the arms of King John V (Portuguese: *João V*), with a banner of the arms of King John I (Portuguese: *João I*).<br><br>
Prince Henry the Navigator (in-game: *Henry the Navigator*, Portuguese: *Infante Dom Henrique, o Navegador*) (1394–1460) was belligerent from c. 1415, and sponsored voyages from then. King John V (1689–1750) ruled Portugal (r. 1706–1750). During Prince Henrique's life, King John I (1357–1433) ruled Portugal (r. 1385–1433), followed by King Edward I (Portuguese: *Duarte I*) (1391–1438) (r. 1433–1438), followed by King Afonso V (Portuguese: *Afonso V*) (1432–1481) (r. 1438–1438). This makes the use of a banner of the arms of John V anachronistic. As John I was king during Henry's prime, and was his father, it is a suitable flag.<br><br>

* **Replaced the Sioux flag**, a fictitious flag, with a new fictitious flag.<br><br>
This flag is based on various Lakota tribal flags to create a more authentic, yet anachronistic, flag.<br><br>

* **Replaced the Spanish flag**, the Cross of Burgundy (Spanish: *Cruz de Borgoña*), with a banner of the arms of Castile and León (Spanish: *Castilla y León*).<br><br>
Queen Isabella I (in-game: *Queen Isabella*, Spanish: *Isabel*) (1451–1504) ruled Castile (Spanish: *Castilla*) (r. 1474–1475), and later jointly ruled Castile (r. 1475–1504) and Aragon (Aragonese: *Aragón*) (r. 1479 to 1504) with King Ferdinand I and IV (Aragonese: *Ferrando I y IV*) (1452–1516, r. 1479 to 1516). They had effective control over the Spanish Empire. Afterwards, Queen Joanna I (Spanish: *Juana*) (1479–1555), who ruled Castile (r. 1504–1555) and Aragon (r. 1516–1555), jointly ruled with King Philip I (Spanish: *Philip*) (1478–1506, r. 1506). Philip I introduced the Cross of Burgandy as the ensign of the Spanish Empire in 1506. This makes the use of the Cross of Burgundy anachronistic.<br><br>

* **Replaced the United States flag**, Betsy Ross's flag, with the flag of Francis Hopkinson.<br><br>
Betsy Ross (1752–1836) was probably lying about her flag being used. Francis Hopkinson (1737–1791)'s flag is based on the American Naval Jack, and is probably more correct.<br><br>

## Notes

### Flags
* The British flag is anachronistic but unchanged; Queen Elizabeth I (1533–1603) ruled England and Ireland (1558–1603). Afterwards, King James VI and I (1566–1625) ruled England and Ireland (r. 1603–1625). James VI and I introduced the King's Colours as the ensign of all English and Scottish ships in 1606. This makes the use of the King's Colours anachronistic.<br><br>
*However*, as Britain as a sovereign state didn't exist until the Scottish *Union with England Act 1707*, and the King's Colours were used by Great Britain during its entire existence from 1707 to 1800, it is the most suitable flag.

## Notes

### Flags
* The British flag is anachronistic but unchanged; Queen Elizabeth I (1533–1603) ruled England and Ireland (1558–1603). Afterwards, King James VI and I (1566–1625) ruled England and Ireland (r. 1603–1625). James VI and I introduced the King's Colours as the ensign of all English and Scottish ships in 1606.<br><br>
*However*, as Britain as a sovereign state didn't exist until the Scottish *Union with England Act 1707*, and the King's Colours were used by Great Britain during its entire existence from 1707 to 1800, it is the most suitable flag.

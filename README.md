## Changes

* Queen Elizabeth I is no longer the AI personality for the British; she has been replaced with King James VI and I.<br>
*This change was made because James VI and I was the first British king; Elizabeth I was queen of England.*

* Replaced most leader portraits with oil paintings instead of CGI images and corrected their names and titles.

* Replaced British, Dutch, French and Japanese flags.

* Fishing boats no longer use population and have a build limit of 20.

* Privateers no longer have black sails and use period-correct bloody flags instead of Jolly Rogers.

* Mother Nature-owned buildings and ships no longer use Jolly Rogers; they have white flags instead.

## Age of Empires III

### Sound Effects
* **Replaced musker shot sounds** with more realistic ones, taken from recordings of British Land Pattern Muskets (AKA Brown Bess)<br><br>

### Flags
* **Replaced the Dutch flag**, a double States Flag (Dutch: *Statenvlag*), with the Prince's Flag (Dutch: *Prinsenvlag*).<br><br>
Maurice of Nassau (Dutch: *Maurits van Nassau*) (1567–1625), later Maurice of Orange (Dutch: *Maurits van Oranje*) ruled most of the Netherlands (Dutch: *Nederland*) (r. c. 1585–1618) as Stadtholder, and later as Prince (r. 1618–1625). The Netherlands did not replace its flag with the States Flag until 1652. This makes the use of the States Flag anachronistic.<br><br>

* **Replaced the French flag**, a banner of the arms of the House of Bourbon (French: *Maison de Bourbon*), with the Tricolour (French: *Drapeau de la France*).<br><br>
Napoleon I (in-game: *Napoleon Bonaparte*, French: *Napoléon I<sup>er</sup>*) (1769–1821) ruled France (French: *France*) (r. 1799–1804) as Premier, and later the French Empire (French: *Empire Français*) (r. 1804–1814, 1815). King Louis XVI (French: *Louis XVI*) (1754–1793) ruled France (r. 1774–1792) before Napoleon I. Louis XVI used the arms of the House of Bourbon, before being deposed during the French Revolution (French: *Révolution française*) (1789–1799), which used the blue, white and red Tricolour from 1794, and during Napoleon's reign. This makes the use of a banner of the arms of the House of Bourbon anachronistic.<br><br>

* **Replaced the German flag**, an Imperial Eagle (German: *Reichsadler*) (associated with the Holy Roman Empire (German: *Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation*) and other German states), with the 1750–1801 State Flag of Prussia (German: *Flagge des Staates Preußen*).<br><br>
King Frederick II (in-game: *Frederick the Great*, German: *Friedrich II.*) (1712–1786) ruled Prussia (German: *Preuße*) (r. 1740–1786). The current banner of arms appears to be of a "generic" German coat of arms, thus anachronistic.<br><br>

<br><br>

* **Replaced the Ottoman flag**, the 1844–1922 flag of the Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Turkish: *دولت عليه عثمانیه*), with a flag taken from 15th century period artwork and descriptions.<br><br>
Suleiman I (in-game: *Suleiman the Magnificent*, Ottoman Turkish: *سليمان اول*) (1494–1566) ruled the Ottoman Empire (r. *1474–1475*). This makes the use of the 1844–1922 flag of the Ottoman Empire anachronistic.<br><br>

<br><br>

* **Replaced the Portuguese flag**, a banner of the arms of King John V (Portuguese: *João V*), with a banner of the arms of King John I (Portuguese: *João I*).<br><br>
Prince Henry the Navigator (in-game: *Henry the Navigator*, Portuguese: *Infante Dom Henrique, o Navegador*) (1394–1460) was belligerent from c. 1415, and sponsored voyages from then. King John V (1689–1750) ruled Portugal (r. 1706–1750). During Prince Henrique's life, King John I (1357–1433) ruled Portugal (r. 1385–1433), followed by King Edward I (Portuguese: *Duarte I*) (1391–1438) (r. 1433–1438), followed by King Afonso V (Portuguese: *Afonso V*) (1432–1481) (r. 1438–1438). This makes the use of a banner of the arms of John V anachronistic. As John I was king during Henry's prime, and was his father, it is a suitable flag.<br><br>

* **Replaced the Spanish flag**, the Cross of Burgundy (Spanish: *Cruz de Borgoña*), with a banner of the arms of Castile and León (Spanish: *Castilla y León*).<br><br>
Queen Isabella I (in-game: *Queen Isabella*, Spanish: *Isabel*) (1451–1504) ruled Castile (Spanish: *Castilla*) (r. 1474–1475), and later jointly ruled Castile (r. 1475–1504) and Aragon (Aragonese: *Aragón*) (r. 1479 to 1504) with King Ferdinand I and IV (Aragonese: *Ferrando I y IV*) (1452–1516, r. 1479 to 1516). They had effective control over the Spanish Empire. Afterwards, Queen Joanna I (Spanish: *Juana*) (1479–1555), who ruled Castile (r. 1504–1555) and Aragon (r. 1516–1555), jointly ruled with King Philip I (Spanish: *Philip*) (1478–1506, r. 1506). Philip I introduced the Cross of Burgandy as the ensign of the Spanish Empire in 1506. This makes the use of the Cross of Burgundy anachronistic.<br><br>

### Notes

### Flags
* The British flag is anachronistic but unchanged; Queen Elizabeth I (1533–1603) ruled England and Ireland (1558–1603). Afterwards, King James VI and I (1566–1625) ruled England and Ireland (r. 1603–1625). James VI and I introduced the King's Colours as the ensign of all English and Scottish ships in 1606. This makes the use of the King's Colours anachronistic.<br><br>
*However*, as Britain as a sovereign state didn't exist until the Scottish *Union with England Act 1707*, and the King's Colours were used by Great Britain during its entire existence from 1707 to 1800, it is the most suitable flag.

### Flags
* **Replaced the Aztec flag**, a fictitious flag, with a Nahuas cultural flag.<br><br>
This flag is anachronistic, but I feel it's more respectful to the Nahaus than a fictitious one.<br><br>

* **Replaced the Iroquois flag**, a fictitious flag, with the Flag of the Haudenosaunee.<br><br>
This flag is anachronistic, but I feel it's more respectful to the Haudenosaunee than a fictitious one.<br><br>

* **Replaced the Sioux flag**, a fictitious flag, with a new fictitious flag.<br><br>
This flag is based on various Lakota tribal flags to create a more authentic, yet anachronistic, flag.<br><br>

## Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties

### Flags

* **Replaced the Indian flag**, The banner of Padishah Akbar now has a moss-green field.<br><br>
Padishah Akbar (1542–1605)'s banner was probably moss-green.<br><br>

* **Replaced the Japanese flag**, The banner of Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu (Japanese: 徳川家康), with the Rising Sun flag (Japanese: 日本の国旗)<br><br>
While the banner of Tokugawa isn't really wrong, the use of the Rising Sun flag dates back centuries in Japan as a universal naval ensign.<br><br>

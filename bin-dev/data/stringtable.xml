        <string _locid="34700">To advance to the Industrial Age, you need 1000 Food and 500 Coin. If the Mines near your town run out, send Settlers to more distant ones, or build a Plantation.</string>
        <string _locid="34701" soundfilename="AMEL4000">The story of why my family first came to the New World begins with the attack on Malta, the last stronghold of a dying order of Crusader-Knights.</string>
        <string _locid="34702" soundfilename="AMEL4005">This much is fact -- my ancestor Morgan Black was with the Knights of St. John when they defended the island from Sahin and the Ottomans.</string>
        <string _locid="34703" soundfilename="AMEL4010">The rest ... well, like most family stories, it's hard to separate the truth from the legend.</string>
        <string _locid="34704" soundfilename="AMEL4100">With Alain Magnan dead and the Fountain destroyed, the Circle of Ossus had nothing left in the New World.</string>
        <string _locid="34705" soundfilename="AMEL4105">Sahin knew the Europeans were carving out empires in the Americas. He realized that the Ottomans were as much relics of the past as the Knights of St. John.</string>
        <string _locid="34707" soundfilename="AMEL4115">Lizzie had lost her Spanish gold, and it would be several years before she really forgave Morgan.</string>
        <string _locid="34708" soundfilename="AMEL4120">I'm not sure if she was really my great-great-grandmother, but folks say I have a pirate's temper.</string>
        <string _locid="34709" soundfilename="AMEL4125">Was there something special about the Fountain's water? </string>
        <string _locid="34710" soundfilename="AMEL4130">All I know for sure is the Circle would return to find out.</string>
        <string _locid="34711" soundfilename="AMEL4200">Everyone always said Morgan's grandson John Black had a lot more enemies than he had friends.</string>
        <string _locid="34712" soundfilename="AMEL4205">But one man, a Mohawk named Kanyenke, always stood by his side -- even if the two did have a friendly rivalry.</string>
        <string _locid="34713" soundfilename="AMEL4300">I don't know exactly what happened on the mountain that day. But my grandfather wasn't the type to go down without a fight.</string>
        <string _locid="34714" soundfilename="AMEL4305">John Black may have made a lot of enemies in his life, but he died a hero. He knocked the Circle back on their heels so hard it would take them decades to recover.</string>
        <string _locid="34715" soundfilename="AMEL4310">By spring, Kanyenke had returned to his village. Life went on for the Iroquois, just as it had for years.</string>
        <string _locid="34716" soundfilename="AMEL4315">Except that his sister had given birth to John's son.</string>
        <string _locid="34717" soundfilename="AMEL4320">And though the Russians were gone, Kanyenke knew other white men would follow.</string>
        <string _locid="34718" soundfilename="AMEL4325">But until then, he would live, work, and help raise his sister's son ...</string>
        <string _locid="34719" soundfilename="AMEL4330">... my father, Nathaniel Black.</string>
        <string _locid="34720" soundfilename="AMEL4400">John's sacrifice did not go unnoticed. My family was rewarded by the British government -- and later, the Americans. By the standards of those days, we got rich.</string>
        <string _locid="34721" soundfilename="AMEL4405">Those were eventful years. We pushed the frontier to the horizon -- building, expanding, heading west.</string>
        <string _locid="34722" soundfilename="AMEL4410">My father Nathaniel was a patriot, but not much of a businessman. By the time he left the company in my hands, the Black family fortune had dried up.</string>
        <string _locid="34723" soundfilename="AMEL4415">And so we come to my part of the story.</string>
        <string _locid="34724" soundfilename="AMEL4500">What I remember most about that day are the smells - black powder, sweat, and too much death.</string>
        <string _locid="34725" soundfilename="AMEL4505">Or maybe all I was smelling was that damn Beaumont.</string>
        <string _locid="34727" soundfilename="AMEL4515">Was the Fountain's water worth it all? I never found out.</string>
        <string _locid="34728" soundfilename="AMEL4520">What I did know was that the Circle had stored a lot of treasure in the Ossuary over the years.</string>
        <string _locid="34729" soundfilename="AMEL4525">Uncle Kanyenke said we shouldn't profit from the Circle's blood money, but most of the gold came from those Spanish treasure ships Morgan and Lizzie sank.</string>
        <string _locid="34730" soundfilename="AMEL4530">The way I figured it, the Circle of Ossus owed the Black family a little something. Don't you agree?</string>

        <string _locid="35936" symbol="cStringRMSAmazonlongdesc">Teams are separated by the mighty Amazon River. Trade Routes and Natives may be separated... or maybe not. Tupi, Carib, or Inca live deep in the rain forests. Build a navy to control the river, and control the map -- but keep an eye out for enemy Outposts and cannon on the shores.</string>
        <string _locid="35937" symbol="cStringRMSAndeslongdesc">A large Inca city dominates the Andes; control the city, and you will easily control the map. Neutral Huari Strongholds are scattered throughout the area, presenting challenges for unwary explorers. Three Trading Post sites. Seek out herds of Llamas for an early boost of food.</string>
        <string _locid="35939" symbol="cStringRMSCaribbeanlongdesc">The islands of the Caribbean support only a few animals, but the ocean offers a bounty of fish. Palm trees provide plenty of Wood for constructing ships.\n \nYou will share an island with your teammates. There will always be an additional island with a Trade Route. Carib settlements are scattered across all the islands.</string>
        <string _locid="35940" symbol="cStringRMSCarolinalongdesc">The southeast coast of North America has plenty of resources and extra Crates. The ease of naval transport and lack of cliffs means you are never too far from your enemy. A Trade Route runs along the coast with four sites for Trading Posts.\n \nThis is the home of the Cherokee, who will always have two villages on the map. Sometimes you may encounter one or two Seminole villages as well.</string>
        <string _locid="35941" symbol="cStringRMSBayoulongdesc">A vast swamp where dry land is at a premium. You can only build on solid ground, but armies can travel across the wetlands, so beware of unexpected ambushes.\n \nCherokee and Seminole villages occupy islands through the middle of the map.</string>
        <string _locid="35942" symbol="cStringRMSGreatLakeslongdesc">Fight around the outside of a large freshwater lake. Control of the single long Trade Route is crucial. Several Iroquois or Lakota villages ring the lake. Resources, including fish, are plentiful.\n \nBuild too close to the shore without controlling the water, and you risk having your town shelled by enemy ships late in the game. Sometimes the lake may be frozen over, presenting a different tactical challenge. </string>
        <string _locid="35943" symbol="cStringRMSGreatPlainslongdesc">Wide-open spaces, large herds of Bison to hunt, plentiful Mines, and as many as six Lakota and Comanche villages offer a wide variety of potential strategies. The Trade Route may have three or five Trading Post sites.\n \nControl the more dense forests near the edges of the map to supplement your late-game wood gathering, or rely on the scattered clumps of trees out on the plains.</string>
        <string _locid="35944" symbol="cStringRMSNewEnglandlongdesc">Each team will have an easily-defended Iroquois or Cherokee village; the fight will be for control of the four Trading Post sites along the single central Trade Route.\n \nLakes and low stone walls provide natural barriers and choke points. Search the isles off the coast for hidden Treasures.</string>
        <string _locid="35946" symbol="cStringRMSPampaslongdesc">A long plain divided by a river with several crossing points.

Expect to find a number of Inca and Tupi villages.</string>
        <string _locid="35947" symbol="cStringRMSPatagonialongdesc">No Natives, but six Trading Posts. To ensure a steady supply of Wood, stay near the coast.\n \nA central lake offers tactical opportunities, and may restrict movement along the western side of the map. The lake is not present in Free for All games.</string>
        <string _locid="35948" symbol="cStringRMSRockieslongdesc">Your team occupies one mountain range and your opponents the other. The victors will be the ones that can control the central valley and the choke points. Forests and Treasures are more heavily concentrated in the center of the map.\n \nThe Lakota and Comanche have ventured up into the mountains, and may prove to be useful allies.</string>
        <string _locid="35949" symbol="cStringRMSSaguenaylongdesc">In this resource-heavy region, you will start with an extra random economic building in addition to your Town Center. Building Outposts near the local Cree and Nootka villages may help control sections of the map.</string>
        <string _locid="35950" symbol="cStringRMSSonoralongdesc">A twisting Trade Route winds its way through this barren, desolate region. Many cliffs and canyons create choke points. Resources can be difficult to find, though sometimes there are rich ore deposits in the center of the map. Search for Aztec and Maya villages on the edge of the map.</string>
        <string _locid="35951" symbol="cStringRMSYucatanlongdesc">The Central America rain forests are home to many Treasures. Each player will start with a nearby Aztec or Maya village. Use your ships to control the land on your side, or try to build a dock on the far shore and control both coasts.\n \nThe dense forests mean you will never run short of Wood, and herds of Tapir and Capybara offer unusual hunting opportunities.</string>
        <string _locid="35952" symbol="cStringRMSYukonlongdesc">Your enemy's towns are close, so be on your guard. Cross the central river and claim the Treasure-rich region to the north. Mines are plentiful on the northern half of the map; expect to struggle until you have a second town.\n \nThe Trade Route will be hard to completely control, with each team having access to one Trading Post site. Two Cree or Nootka villages are found north of the river.</string>

          <b>Game Information:</b>\n The Musketeer is an infantry unit with decent hitpoints, range and a good attack. They are one of the few units available to every Civilization and as such are one of the most common units in the game. \n \n Musketeers are a good all around unit, but not outstanding in any particular trait. Certain Civilizations, like the British, have unique improvements to Musketeers that make them even better than regular fully upgraded Musketeer infantry.

          <b>About Musketeers:</b>\n Musketeers were an infantry soldier who stood in ranks for two and three men deep, taking turns firing while other ranks reloaded. Muskets were drilled and disciplined to stand as close as 80 yards away from an enemy firing right back at them. Musket balls ranged from about 1/2" in diameter to 3/4" in diameter. Until long guns with rifled barrels that could be fired more than once every two minutes were developed, muskets were the ranged weapon of choice for infantry. \n \n Muskets had a relatively short range and were wildly inaccurate.. Musketeers fought an awful lot like longbowmen, firing volley after volley in the direction of the enemy with no specific target. The barrage of lead was bound to hit something. A competent musketeer could fire 3 shots in a minute. Four times slower than a longbow and twice as fast as an early rifle.

        <string _locid="38302">We can fill the British Museum with samples of these new wonders.</string>
        <string _locid="38303">A brave land to hold such discoveries! </string>
        <string _locid="38304">Well done! This should get you off to a quick start.</string>
        <string _locid="38305">Wondrous! With such wealth our cause surges forward.</string>
        <string _locid="38306">You certainly do not waste time getting started, do you?</string>
        <string _locid="38307">You seem to be a very efficient partner. </string>
        <string _locid="38308">You haven't gathered much treasure. I hope it's because you're building up a strong army somewhere.</string>
        <string _locid="38309">It's rather rude to seize treasure so close to your ally's town. I expect better behavior from you.</string>
        <string _locid="38310">I'm sure you won't mind me collecting treasure here, it's all for a good cause.</string>
        <string _locid="38311">Er ... my explorer needs some rest. I won't be making many discoveries for a while.</string>
        <string _locid="38312">My exploration attempts are going to have to be on hold for a while - my explorer had a bit of a mishap. </string>
        <string _locid="38313">Alas, my explorer got caught in the open by enemies and now I cannot gather treasures until he is back. </string>
        <string _locid="38314">Your colony has not progressed to the next Age yet. I hope it's because you're busy building a large army.</string>
        <string _locid="38315">You progress at a remarkable rate. I trust you'll have enough troops to take advantage of your technology.</string>
        <string _locid="38316">That's a relief. I was wondering if you'd ever advance.</string>
        <string _locid="38317">Well done! It may be a moment before I can catch up with you.</string>
        <string _locid="38318">A fine show, my friend. Pray use your new research advantage to hinder our common foe.</string>
        <string _locid="38319">Soon you will have much more powerful troops than I. I will support you the best I can of course. </string>
        <string _locid="38320">I'm curious ... did your battle plan include advancing to the next Age?</string>
        <string _locid="38321">Well, well. An enemy town left undefended. I thought you'd like to know.</string>
        <string _locid="38322">I have spotted an enemy town that doesn't even have a barracks. Our cavalry can run rampant.</string>
        <string _locid="38323">Here is an enemy town with no stable. Perhaps some artillery would be in order.</string>
        <string _locid="38324">Curse this wilderness! My explorer is down.</string>
        <string _locid="38325">They killed my explorer! Please teach them a lesson.</string>
        <string _locid="38326">It feels so good to get my explorer back.</string>
        <string _locid="38327">I have successfully brought my explorer back from the brink of death.</string>
        <string _locid="38328">I am sure your troops were on the way, but I've managed to free my explorer myself. Thanks anyway.</string>
        <string _locid="38329">You saved my explorer! Words cannot express my gratitude.</string>
        <string _locid="38330">You did what I could not. Rescued my explorer. </string>
        <string _locid="38331">Thank you ever so much. My newly-free explorer will work twice as hard to make up for lost time.</string>
        <string _locid="38332">Sadly, I was forced to ransom my explorer. The enemy rejoices.</string>
        <string _locid="38333">This is troubling ... they are turning the natives against us.</string>
        <string _locid="38334">This battle is off to an excellent start. To victory! </string>
        <string _locid="38335">So far so good. </string>
        <string _locid="38336">I do not see how they can stop us now.</string>
        <string _locid="38337">This town needs a British flag ... would you agree?</string>
        <string _locid="38338">It's time to take the war to the foe. Right about here.</string>
        <string _locid="38339">I plan to assault the main enemy base. Can you help?</string>
        <string _locid="38340">I have commanded my armies to attack here.</string>
        <string _locid="38341">My troops are going to target enemy settlers around the map.</string>
        <string _locid="38342">This trade site needs new management.</string>
        <string _locid="38344">It is time to expand my trading empire.</string>
        <string _locid="38345">I am constructing a military base here.</string>
        <string _locid="38346">These natives shall be useful allies.</string>
        <string _locid="38347">I need a town center here.</string>
        <string _locid="38348">That's one less enemy town befouling the landscape.</string>
        <string _locid="38349">That town was better defended than I had hoped.</string>
        <string _locid="38350">So far we are victorious! The enemy base is destroyed.</string>
        <string _locid="38351">The enemy base still stands. He is a tenacious fellow.</string>
        <string _locid="38352">The natives are free once again.</string>
        <string _locid="38353">I'll have to liberate those natives later.</string>
        <string _locid="38354">That's one less trade site for our enemies.</string>
        <string _locid="38355">Perhaps I should send a bigger army next time I attack a trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="38356">My troops shall defend this location.</string>
        <string _locid="38357">This building shall be protected.</string>
        <string _locid="38358">My armies shall defend this native village.</string>
        <string _locid="38359">This trading post shall not fall.</string>
        <string _locid="38360">This town is worth defending.</string>
        <string _locid="38361">I shall supply you with the finest in British cuisine.</string>
        <string _locid="38362">I shall supply you with shipments of wood.</string>
        <string _locid="38363">I shall deliver an endless stream of coin to you.</string>
        <string _locid="38364">Here is some food, eat it in good health.</string>
        <string _locid="38365">Here is some wood, compliments of the British Empire.</string>
        <string _locid="38366">Here is some coin, spend it wisely.</string>
        <string _locid="38367">It has been a noble fight, but I think we should cut our losses to fight again someday. Would you agree?</string>
        <string _locid="38368">Well, we can't win every battle. Perhaps next time we will be the victor. Shall we resign? I'll follow your lead.</string>
        <string _locid="38369">Things certainly aren't looking up - don't you think we should surrender while we can?</string>
        <string _locid="38370">This is absurd! We are wasting our energy ... it's time to admit defeat.</string>
        <string _locid="38371">I'm sorry, but that just isn't possible.</string>
        <string _locid="38372">With all due respect, I am not allowed to do that.</string>
        <string _locid="38373">I would love to, but I cannot afford to comply with your request.</string>
        <string _locid="38374">I would comply immediately, if only I had enough troops.</string>
        <string _locid="38375">I have no army, so I cannot comply.</string>
        <string _locid="38376">As you wish.</string>
        <string _locid="38377">By your command.</string>
        <string _locid="38378">I hasten to obey.</string>
        <string _locid="38379">I shall train more cavalry.</string>
        <string _locid="38380">I shall expand my infantry.</string>
        <string _locid="38381">I shall manufacture artillery units.</string>
        <string _locid="38382">I shall make cavalry and some infantry.</string>
        <string _locid="38383">I shall make cavalry, and build a few artillery units.</string>
        <string _locid="38384">My line of infantry should be able to hold off anything they throw at us, with a few cannon to support them.</string>
        <string _locid="38385">I shall produce infantry alongside the best cavalry I can train.</string>
        <string _locid="38386">I shall manufacture artillery units, and add some cavalry to protect them.</string>
        <string _locid="38387">I shall manufacture artillery units, and protect them with infantry.</string>
        <string _locid="38388">We seem to be in command of the situation.</string>
        <string _locid="38389">We seem to be winning, and you deserve the credit</string>
        <string _locid="38390">We seem to be winning, in spite of your failures.</string>
        <string _locid="38391">I expect the French will resign soon.</string>
        <string _locid="38392">Looks like the Russians won't be in it much longer.</string>
        <string _locid="38393">I think we're winning, but the French might still cause us some problems.</string>
        <string _locid="38394">I'm sure we will win, but the Russians will offer some spirited resistance. </string>
        <string _locid="38395">I fear I may have doomed us to failure, despite your stellar performance.</string>
        <string _locid="38396">Your weaknesses have brought about my downfall.</string>
        <string _locid="38397">We may be losing, but I think we can take France down with us.</string>
        <string _locid="38398">We are beset with difficulties. Let us at least destroy the Russians before we go down to defeat. </string>
        <string _locid="38399">The enemy British have proven stronger than me, I fear.</string>
        <string _locid="38400">The situation looks bad, but I may see a way out - the enemy British are their weak link. Shall we strike?</string>
        <string _locid="38401">I hate to admit it, but the French may prevail.</string>
        <string _locid="38402">These are difficult times, my friend. Perhaps Russia is the nation of the future. </string>
        <string _locid="38403">My attack begins here.</string>
        <string _locid="38404">Trade routes are the lifeblood of a nation.</string>
        <string _locid="38405">I need to protect the few troops I have so far. Perhaps later I can assist you.</string>
        <string _locid="38406">I'm sorry but that is impossible for me.</string>
        <string _locid="38407">My caissons will soon go rolling along.</string>
        <string _locid="38408">I like horses, and I'm glad you do too.</string>
        <string _locid="38409">More footmen - the backbone of our army.</string>
        <string _locid="38410">How nice to get a settler without having to pay for him or ship him from overseas.</string>
        <string _locid="38411">Don't let it go to your head. You can't get enough gold that way to win the war.</string>
        <string _locid="38412">Food? How nice for you.</string>
        <string _locid="38413">I see you've rescued a local.</string>
        <string _locid="38414">Wood is good.</string>
        <string _locid="38415">It is time to expand my trading empire.</string>
        <string _locid="38416">It's almost embarrassing to find nice things like a free settler ... but I'll take it.</string>
        <string _locid="38417">Free money!</string>
        <string _locid="38418">Let me know if you need any of this food.</string>
        <string _locid="38419">Help from the natives. I feel  blessed indeed.</string>
        <string _locid="38420">More lumber to build our towns.</string>
        <string _locid="38421">Well! That was a close fight!</string>
        <string _locid="38422">It was touch and go there for a while.</string>
        <string _locid="38423">It was a near thing, but I've won!</string>
        <string _locid="38424">Actually, that fight was rather dull.</string>
        <string _locid="38425">No surprises there.</string>
        <string _locid="38426">I am going to raid the enemy gatherers.</string>
        <string _locid="38427">The enemy don't seem to be trying their hardest.</string>
        <string _locid="38428">It is time to wall in.</string>
        <string _locid="38429">I need more defenses.</string>
        <string _locid="38430">The enemy has four of a kind! We have to act fast!</string>
        <string _locid="38431">Uh-oh. We need to get our act together, and quickly!</string>
        <string _locid="38432">Now all we have to do is sit back and wait for victory to fall into our laps.</string>
        <string _locid="38433">How sweet - four of a kind!</string>
        <string _locid="38434">It's been so long since we got together, my friend. I see you have been successful in multiplayer. </string>
        <string _locid="38435">I've missed you. We really should fight on the same side more often. </string>
        <string _locid="38436">What happened? Your multiplayer score has plummeted!</string>
        <string _locid="38437">I am sorrowful. I had to buy back my explorer from the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="38438">Poor baby! I see you have been losing a lot in multiplayer. Your score is so much lower than before.</string>
        <string _locid="38439">It's been soooo long since our last encounter. Have you been seeing someone else?</string>
        <string _locid="38440">You are so much more powerful and impressive than last time we met. This should be fun!</string>
        <string _locid="38441">This map? Again?</string>
        <string _locid="38442">We lost last time we were together. Let us learn from our mistakes.</string>
        <string _locid="38443">Last time we were allied, we did not do so well. I'm sure we'll work together much better now.</string>
        <string _locid="38444">I have every confidence we will win today, just like we did the last time I was here at your side.</string>
        <string _locid="38445">I feel a little embarrassed about my performance last game. Thank you for taking another chance on me.</string>
        <string _locid="38446">I hope you're able to do better than our last experience together.</string>
        <string _locid="38447">I didn't have the heart to defeat you in our last game. I'm glad we're on the same side now.</string>
        <string _locid="38448">Now they have the natives on their side.</string>
        <string _locid="38449">Remember when I crushed you last time? Ah ... those were the days.</string>
        <string _locid="38450">How annoying. Now we have to start the countdown all over again.</string>
        <string _locid="38451">The enemy has already allied with the natives!</string>
        <string _locid="38452">The poor natives - they are being deluded by our enemy's lies.</string>
        <string _locid="38453">Now the foe has claimed a trade route. It seems like we are behind.</string>
        <string _locid="38454">The enemy has a trading post? Surely we can match him tit for tat.</string>
        <string _locid="38455">They have more native allies than we do. Shouldn't we be doing something about that?</string>
        <string _locid="38456">The enemy is certainly obsessive about hoarding trading sites.</string>
        <string _locid="38457">I am proud to see what you are doing. More natives means more warriors available to us.</string>
        <string _locid="38458">I am glad to see we are keeping ahead in the trade race.</string>
        <string _locid="38459">See here? A town, but no army to protect it!</string>
        <string _locid="38460">Now we have the first native allies! Wonderful!</string>
        <string _locid="38461">We are the first to claim a trade route. </string>
        <string _locid="38462">You can relax now. The threat is ended.</string>
        <string _locid="38463">I have enlisted the help of the natives.</string>
        <string _locid="38464">They say England is a nation of shopkeepers. Well, those shops power a great economy, and this trading post will do the same for us.</string>
        <string _locid="38465">See what I have done? Yet more natives to fight at our side.</string>
        <string _locid="38466">I am adding more trading posts to our string.</string>
        <string _locid="38467">We are in for a tougher fight than last time we met.</string>
        <string _locid="38468">This fight should be a lot less stressful than the last one.</string>
        <string _locid="38469">We are 60 seconds from losing. Shall we surrender now and spare ourselves the ignominy, or make one last push to overthrow the enemy's four of a kind?</string>
        <string _locid="38470">This town has no ability to train infantry. This means our cavalry should meet with little opposition.</string>
        <string _locid="38471">We are 60 seconds from victory! Let us enjoy the final moments of this contest by watching our enemy writhe in the agonies of his failure.</string>
        <string _locid="38472">Just one minute before our triumph, my friend! It may be a bit premature, but let me congratulate on a game well fought.</string>
        <string _locid="38473">Ack! I need help right here right now!</string>
        <string _locid="38474">I hate to bother you, but if you don't immediately send some troops to this point, I'm going to be in big trouble.</string>
        <string _locid="38475">Help is on the way.</string>
        <string _locid="38476">My forces are marching here as fast as they can.</string>
        <string _locid="38477">We are coming to back you up.</string>
        <string _locid="38478">No need to worry. My troops are on the way.</string>
        <string _locid="38479">Just hold out a little longer. I'm coming.</string>
        <string _locid="38480">We are coming to relieve your hard-fighting soldiers.</string>
        <string _locid="38481">Since this town does not have a stable, we should be safe sending in light troops and artillery to attack it.</string>
        <string _locid="38482">I am proud to be your ally in this struggle.</string>
        <string _locid="38483">Excuse me, but I'm a little short of coin at the moment. Can you spare some?</string>
        <string _locid="38484">I am embarrassed to admit it, but I don't have enough coin to accomplish this task. Can you send me some?</string>
        <string _locid="38485">My people are hungry. Do you have any extra food?</string>
        <string _locid="38486">I have a food shortage. Can you spare some?</string>
        <string _locid="38487">I can't seem to cut down trees fast enough. Please send me some wood if you can.</string>
        <string _locid="38488">I need you to give me some wood, dear.</string>
        <string _locid="38489">Thanks so much. I couldn't have held out much longer.</string>
        <string _locid="38490">I really appreciate the help you gave me back there.</string>
        <string _locid="38491">My gratitude for the aid you rendered my base.</string>
        <string _locid="38492">The enemy murdered my explorer!</string>
        <string _locid="38493">My royal thanks for helping me win this victory.</string>
        <string _locid="38494">We could never have won this fight without your timely aid.</string>
        <string _locid="38495">This team up may have won us the war.</string>
        <string _locid="38496">Thank you ever so much for the coin.</string>
        <string _locid="38497">We give thanks for all the resources.</string>
        <string _locid="38498">This food is great! It really hits the spot.</string>
        <string _locid="38499">Now I can build what I need.</string>
        <string _locid="38500">I think you have bitten off more than you can chew, my friend. Perhaps a strategic withdrawal is in order.</string>
        <string _locid="38501">This fight is too much for you. Pull back for now, and return when you are stronger.</string>
        <string _locid="38502">Send in more cannon and field pieces, my friend! I believe that would bring victor! </string>
        <string _locid="38503">My explorer has been lost to the enemy!</string>
        <string _locid="38504">You seem to have a shortage of cannon and shot - perhaps if you had more artillery you would do better.</string>
        <string _locid="38505">Ride them down! Oh ... wait. You don't have enough cavalry. Perhaps you should rectify that error.</string>
        <string _locid="38506">If only we had access to more cavalry, I think we could defeat them.</string>
        <string _locid="38507">We cannot stand up to the enemy unless we can get more infantry into the fight.</string>
        <string _locid="38508">See what the foe is sending against us? We could defeat them if only we had more infantry.</string>
        <string _locid="38509">So ... read any good books lately?</string>
        <string _locid="38510">War: a series of catastrophes which result in peace.</string>
        <string _locid="38511">You can see civilization advancing - in every war you get killed in a new way.</string>
        <string _locid="38512">Have at you!</string>
        <string _locid="38513">Take THAT!</string>
        <string _locid="38514">I am about to bring the war to our foe. Follow my lead.</string>
        <string _locid="38515">It is dangerous here on the frontier! Now my explorer has been incapacitated. </string>
        <string _locid="38516">Surprise!</string>
        <string _locid="38517">An extra settler or two can do you no real good.</string>
        <string _locid="38518">A few driblets of coin here and there will not change the outcome.</string>
        <string _locid="38519">A bit of extra food can't help you.</string>
        <string _locid="38520">One warrior, more or less, does not make an army.</string>
        <string _locid="38521">Wood? What can you do with that?</string>
        <string _locid="38522">My empire grows more quickly than ever!</string>
        <string _locid="38523">Ah ... riches. </string>
        <string _locid="38524">Food just seems to drop out of the trees for me.</string>
        <string _locid="38525">Even the natives want to join my side. I guess they sense who is likelier to win.</string>
        <string _locid="38526">It's nice to get wood without all that lumberjack labor.</string>
        <string _locid="38527">As I expected, the victory is mine.</string>
        <string _locid="38528">To the victor belong the spoils.</string>
        <string _locid="38529">What a disaster! You are a tough opponent.</string>
        <string _locid="38530">Ouch. Perhaps you could go easier on me next time?</string>
        <string _locid="38531">You have been practicing. Your rating has jumped up since last we met.</string>
        <string _locid="38532">You poor soul. I see your multiplayer score has dropped. Should I take it easy on you this time around?</string>
        <string _locid="38533">It seems like weeks since last we met. </string>
        <string _locid="38534">This same map?! Again?</string>
        <string _locid="38535">Couldn't you take the pressure? I see you've tilted the odds more in your favor this game.</string>
        <string _locid="38536">You are brave to face more enemies than your last game.</string>
        <string _locid="38537">The fight is not over yet. Your stupid timer does not mean we are tossing in the towel.</string>
        <string _locid="38539">All those trading posts! Which one shall I destroy first?</string>
        <string _locid="38540">Haha! Now you will have to start over again.</string>
        <string _locid="38541">You didn't need those particular natives, did you?</string>
        <string _locid="38542">Down with the usurper! I mean you, of course.</string>
        <string _locid="38543">Great Britain feels it necessary to inform you that your trading post is no more. (laughs)</string>
        <string _locid="38545">I got the first trade site! Victory is assured!</string>
        <string _locid="38546">Those walls are so decorative. I hope you don't think they'll be practical as well.</string>
        <string _locid="38547">I like the way your walls look. I'll be careful only to poke a few holes in them.</string>
        <string _locid="38548">You certainly are quick to claim the natives. Afraid I'd get there first?</string>
        <string _locid="38549">You already need a trading post? Mismanage something early on, did you?</string>
        <string _locid="38550">What did those hapless natives ever do to you?</string>
        <string _locid="38551">Aren't you supposed to be fighting soldiers, not mere trading sites?</string>
        <string _locid="38552">I wish you'd stop trespassing on my property. Look. Now you've broken it.</string>
        <string _locid="38553">Well ... it was fun while it lasted.</string>
        <string _locid="38554">You have given me a higher difficulty rating. This time I should put up a real challenge for you.</string>
        <string _locid="38555">Even at this new, lower, difficulty rating, I trust I will be able to put up a good fight for you.</string>
        <string _locid="38556">Hear that? The clock is ticking now. Just a few short minutes and you LOSE!</string>
        <string _locid="38557">It seems there is nothing I can do to keep you from winning. But there is still a little time for me to take action.</string>
        <string _locid="38558">Look at the timer. Tick, tick, tick. The countdown to doom.</string>
        <string _locid="38559">That treasure is now mine by right of armed conquest.</string>
        <string _locid="38560">How adorable. You have sent soldiers to try to invade my town.</string>
        <string _locid="38561">I can see your army wandering about aimlessly.</string>
        <string _locid="38562">I can see your explorer now.</string>
        <string _locid="38563">These are dark times. I regret the necessity of annihilating you.</string>
        <string _locid="38564">You can save your men's lives by giving up now.</string>
        <string _locid="38565">It seems I have the upper edge on you. How nice.</string>
        <string _locid="38566">I must say it is a pleasure to see your soldiers take to their heels.</string>
        <string _locid="38567">Look at the size of this fight. EVERYONE wants to get in on the action!</string>
        <string _locid="38568">Feeling standoffish? I notice the new walls around your base.</string>
        <string _locid="38569">Do you think they're going to try to raid us? I see your walls.</string>
        <string _locid="38570">Those false British are just about out of the door. Your troops plus my loyalists have shown them up.</string>
        <string _locid="38571">As we should have expected, the British are stout opponents. Luckily you have some British on your side as well.</string>
        <string _locid="38572">I have fought tougher Dutch than these before. These just seem to cave right in when we attack.</string>
        <string _locid="38573">It is exceedingly irritating that the Dutch are so stubborn.</string>
        <string _locid="38574">The Germans cannot stand up to my fine lobsterbacks.</string>
        <string _locid="38575">What can we do about the Germans?</string>
        <string _locid="38578">I believe the Portuguese have been put paid to.</string>
        <string _locid="38579">The Portuguese are a real problem. Do you have any suggestions for how to deal with them?</string>
        <string _locid="38580">Well at least the Spanish are practically down for the count.</string>
        <string _locid="38581">The Spanish are proving to be redoubtable foemen. I hope you can see the way to overcome their might.</string>
        <string _locid="38582">Emergency! The enemy is hitting me hard! </string>
        <string _locid="38583">Who knew the Dutch would prove so strong?</string>
        <string _locid="38584">We might lose, but the Dutch are as weak as we.</string>
        <string _locid="38585">The German army is old-fashioned and out of date. Let us destroy them before we ourselves are destroyed.</string>
        <string _locid="38586">I did what I could, but it was not enough to enable us to win.</string>
        <string _locid="38587">Your weaknesses have brought about my downfall.</string>
        <string _locid="38589">The Turks are the most vulnerable enemy we have. Let us see if they can be destroyed before we are.</string>
        <string _locid="38590">In past decades, Portugal had often proved a powerful ally to England. Sadly, it seems that Portugal is equally powerful as a foe.</string>
        <string _locid="38591">Even though we're the underdogs in this fight, I think we can at least take the Portuguese down with us.</string>
        <string _locid="38592">It certainly looks like the Spanish are going to have vengeance for our sinking their Armada back in 1588.</string>
        <string _locid="38593">Things look bad. But the Spanish house seems rather rotten, if you get my meaning. Let us kick in their doors! </string>
        <string _locid="38594">Curses! Now another of them has joined the fray. We need more troops to counter them! </string>
        <string _locid="38595">We kill them and kill them, and yet more keep coming. What can we do? </string>
        <string _locid="38596">Excellent! You have gathered your troops together so we can destroy them all at once. How thoughtful.</string>
        <string _locid="38597">We  gathered our troops together here specifically in hopes that you would gather yours together to face us. Thank you for obliging us.</string>
        <string _locid="38598">We make a good team, my friend. Let us march forward, arm in arm, to our certain triumph.</string>
        <string _locid="38599">All is well at this time. We must still be vigilant, but I believe the outcome of this war will be favorable.</string>
        <string _locid="38600">Well, the enemy is slipping behind. You have been of some assistance, at least.</string>
        <string _locid="38601">The foe is almost beaten. It is safe for you to start fighting now.</string>
        <string _locid="38602">I think this war has turned in our favor, thanks to you.</string>
        <string _locid="38603">Your strength has carried this alliance. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</string>
        <string _locid="38604">You may have forgotten about me, but I have not forgotten about you.</string>
        <string _locid="38605">Thank you for the respite from combat. I can use this extra time to prepare for your defeat.</string>
        <string _locid="38606">Are you trying to hide? I see no signs of life.</string>
        <string _locid="38607">That's hardly cricket, is it? Teaming up against me?</string>
        <string _locid="38608">It takes two of you to defeat me? What kind of soldier are you, anyway?</string>
        <string _locid="38609">Now you see our true power. We fight as a team, my ally and I. You cannot stop us both! </string>
        <string _locid="38610">You thought you had me didn't you? Admit it. You didn't reckon on reinforcements! </string>
        <string _locid="38611">Excellent! You have gathered your troops together so we can destroy them all at once. How thoughtful.</string>
        <string _locid="38612">We  gathered our troops here specifically in hope that you would gather yours together to face us. Thank you for obliging us.</string>
        <string _locid="38613">Perhaps I can at least retrieve some dignity out of this debacle. Kind sir, will you accept my surrender?</string>
        <string _locid="38614">No more native allies for our enemy after this attack!</string>
        <string _locid="38616">Nothing I can do can save my town now. I am doomed. There is nothing but surrender left to me. Will you accept it?</string>
        <string _locid="38617">My explorer has been hurt. I don't suppose you could spare a soldier or two to help him back into action?</string>
        <string _locid="38618">You have failed. I have successfully retrieved my explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="38619">You could not hold my crafty explorer for long. </string>
        <string _locid="38620">My explorer is back with me and as good as new. </string>
        <string _locid="38621">Your native allies cannot save you.</string>
        <string _locid="38622">I didn't want that particular native town anyway.</string>
        <string _locid="38623">What do you think you are doing? Killing settlers violates all civilized laws of war.</string>
        <string _locid="38624">Stop chasing my settlers at once. You have fair warning.</string>
        <string _locid="38625">I warn you. Continue raiding my settlers and I shall respond in kind. </string>
        <string _locid="38626">I shall destroy the enemy trading post here.</string>
        <string _locid="38627">Your army may be massive, but my heart is pure, and my soldiers each fight with the strength of ten.</string>
        <string _locid="38628">You certainly have a lot of soldiers. I suspect this means you've skimped on equipping and training them.</string>
        <string _locid="38629">Hmm. Nice large army. Let's see how it holds up in battle.</string>
        <string _locid="38630">Your army doesn't seem quite large enough to  be a threat. I wonder what you plan to do with it.</string>
        <string _locid="38631">I see your force maneuvering in the wilderness. Perhaps it's worth my while to destroy it.</string>
        <string _locid="38632">I doubt you dare attack me with an army that size.</string>
        <string _locid="38633">You'd better pick up your toys and scurry home.</string>
        <string _locid="38634">What a tiny army! Is this a trick of some kind?</string>
        <string _locid="38635">I imagine the reason your army is so small is that you'd hoped in vain that it would escape notice. </string>
        <string _locid="38636">You are causing me serious discomfort.</string>
        <string _locid="38637">I want a base here. Soon it will teem with soldiers.</string>
        <string _locid="38638">Please ... have mercy! </string>
        <string _locid="38639">Can we discuss a temporary cease fire? Perhaps your troops could use a break from their labors. </string>
        <string _locid="38640">Your town is rather out on a limb, isn't it?</string>
        <string _locid="38641">Feeling standoffish I see - didn't want to be too near your smelly old neighbors?</string>
        <string _locid="38642">I can see your town now. My soldiers know where to head! </string>
        <string _locid="38643">Thank you for putting your town in such an obvious spot. It was easy to discover.</string>
        <string _locid="38644">You must be afraid of me - your towns are so near to one another.</string>
        <string _locid="38645">You built so very very near your ally. I wonder if it is some kind of strange plan, or just a mistake?</string>
        <string _locid="38646">Did you forget something? Like progressing in Age?</string>
        <string _locid="38647">You certainly are quick to jump up in Age. I suspect this indicates that your economy is lagging well behind mine.</string>
        <string _locid="38648">I am going to build a town here.</string>
        <string _locid="38649">What took you so long to reach Colonial?</string>
        <string _locid="38650">Still in the Discovery Age?! Haven't you discovered enough, yet?</string>
        <string _locid="38651">How impolite. That treasure was clearly intended for me.</string>
        <string _locid="38652">Off to a good beginning!</string>
        <string _locid="38653">You have scooped up so many treasures. What a fine fellow!</string>
        <string _locid="38654">I appreciate your letting me collect all the treasure, but I have enough. Really. You can get some now if you like.</string>
        <string _locid="38655">A fine treasure indeed. I can't imagine why you hadn't gathered it already.</string>
        <string _locid="38656">You have done a good job with your colony so far. But not good enough.</string>
        <string _locid="38657">Now that you are so far advanced in Age, your uniforms must seem fine indeed. But I doubt your fighting quality has improved.</string>
        <string _locid="38658">My next town center is to be at this location.</string>
        <string _locid="38659">I am impressed by your speed in advancing your colony. But not frightened.</string>
        <string _locid="38660">Your success in making discoveries may help console you when you have lost the war.</string>
        <string _locid="38661">I see you are wasting your time on penny-ante looting.</string>
        <string _locid="38662">A paltry treasure here or there makes no difference in the long run.</string>
        <string _locid="38663">You are so backward! What will your soldiers use to fight mine? Clubs? </string>
        <string _locid="38664">You are so nice, to choose to fight me while you are an Age inferior. How sweet.</string>
        <string _locid="38665">Yes, you have reached Colonial Age first. I suppose I should congratulate you. </string>
        <string _locid="38666">So soon? I must marshal my forces.</string>
        <string _locid="38667">At last you have joined the rest of us in the Colonial Age.</string>
        <string _locid="38668">You are Colonial at last? How quaint. We are all moving on to the next Age.</string>
        <string _locid="38669">Native warriors are brave and resourceful.</string>
        <string _locid="38670">Are you aware that it is possible to advance to the Colonial Age? </string>
        <string _locid="38671">Still back in the Discovery Age?! How delightful.</string>
        <string _locid="38672">This wealth will go straight into my war chest.</string>
        <string _locid="38673">See how my explorer makes good use of his time? You can learn by my example.</string>
        <string _locid="38674">Every time I make such a lucrative discovery, it's one less find for you.</string>
        <string _locid="38675">That's pretty bold of you, coming that near to my base.</string>
        <string _locid="38676">What daring! Stealing a treasure from under my very nose!</string>
        <string _locid="38677">You made the first find?! Hmph. Beginner's luck.</string>
        <string _locid="38678">Don't you realize that these paltry treasures don't count in the long run?</string>
        <string _locid="38679">You are good at exploring the wilderness, but other skills will be needed once the fighting begins in earnest.</string>
        <string _locid="38680">The native tribes will be good to have at our side.</string>
        <string _locid="38681">You must have a lot of time on your hands, to waste it gathering treasures.</string>
        <string _locid="38682">Can't you find anything? Perhaps it's because my gallant explorer has already gathered up all the treasures.</string>
        <string _locid="38683">I really appreciate your leaving all the treasure-gathering to me. It's too kind.</string>
        <string _locid="38684">Heehee! I have stolen one of your treasures right from under your nose! </string>
        <string _locid="38685">Saving that treasure for later? Too late now!</string>
        <string _locid="38686">I feel bad about this, but I don't have enough resources to obey you.</string>
        <string _locid="38687">Sorry. I'm too poor to do that.</string>
        <string _locid="38688">I have not trained an army yet.</string>
        <string _locid="38689">Sorry, I don't have any troops.</string>
        <string _locid="38690">If I had a few more men, they would rush to your aid.</string>
        <string _locid="38691">Alas, we have all but lost. I regret I was not a more useful ally to you.</string>
        <string _locid="38692">In a minute it will all be over. Next time I will apply myself more effectively.</string>
        <string _locid="38693">(laughs) You fought magnificently. Victory will be ours in moments.</string>
        <string _locid="38694">Prepare to celebrate. In one minute we will have won.</string>
        <string _locid="38695">Your sovereign remedy for this battle is to field more artillery units!</string>
        <string _locid="38696">I suggest you construct additional artillery units.</string>
        <string _locid="38697">I recommend you bring more cavalry to bear in this battle at once.</string>
        <string _locid="38698">Cavalry, commander! You need more cavalry in that fight!</string>
        <string _locid="38699">Your forces in this battle need more infantry units.</string>
        <string _locid="38700">If you field more infantry for that battle you'll fare better.</string>
        <string _locid="38701">He who defends everything defends nothing. I strongly suggest retreat. </string>
        <string _locid="38702">Unless you want to lose every soldier in that army, I recommend you retreat now.</string>
        <string _locid="38703">The clash of several armies shatters the lands. Guard against a decisive blow!</string>
        <string _locid="38704">Troops from several armies fight here. We must coordinate our efforts to wrench victory from this chaos.</string>
        <string _locid="38705">To defeat you I applied one of my most fundamental principles: I attacked briskly and with good order, always endeavoring to gain ground.</string>
        <string _locid="38706">It has been my military tradition to win. Yours is shaping up to be defeated.</string>
        <string _locid="38707">The outcome of that battle has left me speechless. However, the outcome of the war will speak of my victory.</string>
        <string _locid="38708">That battle was not one I care to have the history books learn about.</string>
        <string _locid="38709">My bold attitude alone would have been enough to win that battle.</string>
        <string _locid="38710">I presume you foresaw the outcome of that battle as plainly as I did: victory.</string>
        <string _locid="38711">I am pleased with the outcome of that fight after all.</string>
        <string _locid="38712">In the battle at hand our enemy shall feel the imposition of my heel upon his face.</string>
        <string _locid="38713">My reputation alone would be enough to rout their army in this fight.</string>
        <string _locid="38714">Your arrival was timely; the battle is turning in our favor.</string>
        <string _locid="38715">I have to admit I am very glad you have arrived.</string>
        <string _locid="38716">Alert, my ally -- an additional opponent has joined the fray and our prospects for victory here fade quickly!</string>
        <string _locid="38717">The battle is going against us.</string>
        <string _locid="38718">This will be a bitter conflict; the enemy's numbers have increased.</string>
        <string _locid="38719">We now face another foe as well.</string>
        <string _locid="38720">Of course.</string>
        <string _locid="38721">Yes, your request is exactly what I would have suggested.</string>
        <string _locid="38722">Not an issue. I'll comply.</string>
        <string _locid="38723">Yes.</string>
        <string _locid="38724">Construction of artillery to commence.</string>
        <string _locid="38725">Request to train artillery acknowledged. Will do.</string>
        <string _locid="38726">Yes. Artillery lends dignity to what might otherwise be a vulgar brawl.</string>
        <string _locid="38727">Agree. Great guns are the most respectable argument.</string>
        <string _locid="38728">Artillery units and cavalry support shall be provided.</string>
        <string _locid="38729">Artillery units are an outstanding option. I'll train cavalry units as well.</string>
        <string _locid="38730">Agreed. Artillery and infantry support troops shall be provided.</string>
        <string _locid="38731">Yes, artillery and infantry units on their way.</string>
        <string _locid="38732">At once. You need additional cavalry and I will supply them.</string>
        <string _locid="38733">Cavalry units shall be trained and fielded at once.</string>
        <string _locid="38734">Cavalry units shall be provided along with some artillery.</string>
        <string _locid="38735">I shall create some cavalry and artillery. Use them wisely.</string>
        <string _locid="38736">Without essential cavalry and footsoldiers an army is nothing. I will provide both for you as requested.</string>
        <string _locid="38737">My infantry and cavalry units are on their way.</string>
        <string _locid="38738">I agree with your recommendation. Infantry presence on the battlefield will be increased.</string>
        <string _locid="38739">Yes, I'll recruit more infantry units.</string>
        <string _locid="38740">Strategically sound. I can agree to train more infantry and a few artillery units as well.</string>
        <string _locid="38741">I will. Infantry and supporting artillery are vital elements in a conquering army.</string>
        <string _locid="38742">I concur. Infantry and cavalry shall be added to my army.</string>
        <string _locid="38743">Well-trained footsoldiers and elite cavalry units will be fielded.</string>
        <string _locid="38744">Without supplies, no army is brave. I will not leave my troops cowering so I must deny your request for resources.</string>
        <string _locid="38745">I cannot comply at the moment.</string>
        <string _locid="38746">I cannot spare the resources.</string>
        <string _locid="38747">I can spare advice, but not resources.</string>
        <string _locid="38748">To that request I cannot concur.</string>
        <string _locid="38749">I cannot comply.</string>
        <string _locid="38750">No. My priorities are elsewhere at the moment.</string>
        <string _locid="38751">There is no way I can do that at this time.</string>
        <string _locid="38752">There will be no push of bayonets from me -- I have no army.</string>
        <string _locid="38753">My empire has no army at the moment.</string>
        <string _locid="38754">As soon as I have trained sufficient forces I can assist you. At present I have none.</string>
        <string _locid="38755">My soldiers are not ready to enter battle.</string>
        <string _locid="38756">That request is beyond even me. No.</string>
        <string _locid="38757">I am afraid that is not something I can do.</string>
        <string _locid="38758">That won't be possible.</string>
        <string _locid="38759">I have determined that is impossible.</string>
        <string _locid="38760">My army is of insufficient size to comply.</string>
        <string _locid="38761">Write to me again after I have actually assembled an army.</string>
        <string _locid="38762">Our enemy has destroyed one of our trading posts, but this war is far from over.</string>
        <string _locid="38763">We almost conquered them unconventionally. We'll just have to do it the ordinary way this time.</string>
        <string _locid="38764">For a moment there it looked like we might defeat them that way.</string>
        <string _locid="38765">Our enemy managed to stop our monopoly. We'll just have to conquer them another way.</string>
        <string _locid="38766">Our British opponent is nearly routed. Perhaps they will be able to construct a raft from broken muskets on which to sail home to their frail island.</string>
        <string _locid="38767">It looks like we've taken the pluck out of plucky little Britain.</string>
        <string _locid="38768">The British era of conquest and colonization is over.</string>
        <string _locid="38769">Although the British have all but lost this battle, at least they have their soggy little rock to swim home to.</string>
        <string _locid="38770">Our Dutch foe is about to fall. They will soon be forced to return in shame to the lagoon they call a country.</string>
        <string _locid="38771">Plainly the Dutch are about to collapse under our onslaught. All they will have left to be proud of are their wooden shoes.</string>
        <string _locid="38772">If the Dutch had spent less time doting over their tulips and more time training their soldiers, they might have had a chance.</string>
        <string _locid="38773">The Dutch really should focus on building windmills. Clearly they know very little about warfare.</string>
        <string _locid="38774">It is all but over for the French.</string>
        <string _locid="38775">The French may have been fearsome at one time, but after this battle I'd suggest they just stay in the kitchen.</string>
        <string _locid="38776">The French used to be dangerous. At this point I'd only call them frightful.</string>
        <string _locid="38777">Some dominating military power the French have turned out to be. Their croissants would probably put up more of a fight.</string>
        <string _locid="38778">Our German opponent has all but lost.</string>
        <string _locid="38779">Our German foe has nearly been defeated. They should hang their heads in shame.</string>
        <string _locid="38780">Since I was not leading their armies, it doesn't surprise me to see our German enemy is nearly defeated.</string>
        <string _locid="38781">The Ottoman foe is almost defeated.</string>
        <string _locid="38782">The Ottomans are almost destroyed. I hope they have some camels left to ride home on.</string>
        <string _locid="38783">It looks like the Ottomans have run out of tricks. I wonder if they will try to sell some of their cannon at a yard sale?</string>
        <string _locid="38784">The Ottomans have just about run out of gunpowder. And everything else.</string>
        <string _locid="38785">Our Portuguese opponent has almost fallen.</string>
        <string _locid="38786">The Portuguese have been nearly beaten.</string>
        <string _locid="38787">It looks like the Portuguese have just about had it. They should probably just stick with fishing.</string>
        <string _locid="38788">Our armies have just about rolled our Portuguese foe.</string>
        <string _locid="38789">The Russians were worthy opponents, but they have all but lost this war.</string>
        <string _locid="38790">I thought we would never see an end to the Russian soldiers, but that well has just about dried up now.</string>
        <string _locid="38791">The Russians kept on coming, but now they are just doing a lot of dying.</string>
        <string _locid="38792">You would think that with a motherland the size of Russia's that they could maintain a serious attack, but it looks like they are close to defeat.</string>
        <string _locid="38793">The Spanish are about to concede defeat, I would wager.</string>
        <string _locid="38794">It looks like the Spanish have had it with fighting. </string>
        <string _locid="38795">The Spanish are good at fighting bulls, but it looks like they have some things to learn about fighting men.</string>
        <string _locid="38796">The Spanish were worthy foes, but we've pounded the fight out of them.</string>
        <string _locid="38797">I never underestimate a foe, but I am surprised at the tenacity of our British opponent.</string>
        <string _locid="38798">The British are putting up a remarkable fight, even if they do live on a wet rock in the middle of the sea.</string>
        <string _locid="38799">I don't know how the British can be fighting so well. Didn't anyone tell them they were not allowed off their little island?</string>
        <string _locid="38800">The Dutch always surprise me. A land of flowers and windmills, yet they challenge even such as I.</string>
        <string _locid="38801">Don't the Dutch have anything better to do than fight in the New World? Although, I must say they are doing it very well.</string>
        <string _locid="38802">Our French enemy is showing exceptional resolve in this conflict.</string>
        <string _locid="38803">Whoever is commanding the French knows what he or she is doing.</string>
        <string _locid="38804">The French are fighting as fiercely as my own troops. We must be wary of him.</string>
        <string _locid="38805">I do not want to believe it, but I must accept the fact: the French are a potent force in this conflict.</string>
        <string _locid="38806">The Germans are never to be trifled with, but this opponent is exceptional.</string>
        <string _locid="38807">The enemy Germans are fighting like they were commanded by me. I don't like it.</string>
        <string _locid="38808">If we do not defeat the Ottomans quickly we may find them knocking at our own doors.</string>
        <string _locid="38809">Our Ottoman foe is potent. We'll have to deal with him very carefully.</string>
        <string _locid="38810">Our Portuguese opponent is mighty. We'll have to apply all of my strategic brilliance to defeat them.</string>
        <string _locid="38811">We cannot underestimate the Portuguese. At least, we had better not.</string>
        <string _locid="38812">Where the Portuguese are concerned I do not feel so bold. They are worthy foes.</string>
        <string _locid="38813">The Russians are fighting with a ferocity I might not have expected from them. They are truly dangerous.</string>
        <string _locid="38814">Whoever is leading the Russians is impressing even me. We must be careful.</string>
        <string _locid="38815">We must not underestimate our Spanish opponent -- they are demonstrating great resolve.</string>
        <string _locid="38816">The Spanish are strong; we must handle them carefully.</string>
        <string _locid="38817">Although I never doubt our eventual victory, I can see that the Spanish are not going to take our conquest lying down.</string>
        <string _locid="38818">The Spanish seem to have a military answer for every action we take. This may not be as easy as I thought.</string>
        <string _locid="38819">You have advanced long before I have chosen to, but do not fire until you see the whites of their eyes!</string>
        <string _locid="38820">You are wise to advance your colony. Use the new technologies it affords you to decimate our foes.</string>
        <string _locid="38821">You are ahead of me, my ally. I will endeavor to catch up.</string>
        <string _locid="38822">Observe; they have captured the cooperation of some natives.</string>
        <string _locid="38823">They have built a trading post at a native village. Let us make it a point to destroy it as soon as possible.</string>
        <string _locid="38824">I admire unusual strategies, but I am at a loss to know what strategy delaying your Age advancement could belong to.</string>
        <string _locid="38825">You are still in the Discovery Age. Surely you will want an army when our enemy comes to visit?</string>
        <string _locid="38826">It is difficult to defend one's town while in the Discovery Age. Perhaps it is time to advance.</string>
        <string _locid="38827">To do that which your enemy least expects is brilliant, but I don't know if choosing not to advance to the next Age would fall under that category.</string>
        <string _locid="38828">I suggest you follow my lead and advance to the next Age as soon as possible.</string>
        <string _locid="38829">Exploring the New World is fine, but if you do not advance to the next Age soon, you may find your explorer fighting the enemy single-handed.</string>
        <string _locid="38830">Remarkable work. Continue to use your resources as wisely as I do, and we shall be assured victory.</string>
        <string _locid="38831">Excellent. You have reached the Colonial Age quickly.</string>
        <string _locid="38832">Your advancement to the next Age is an inspiration to my men.</string>
        <string _locid="38833">Although I advanced an Age before you, I expect your assistance in this war may still contribute to our eventual victory.</string>
        <string _locid="38834">Do not be discouraged by your slow progress to the Colonial Age. Not everyone is Frederick the Great.</string>
        <string _locid="38835">Even though you have reached the Colonial Age last, you may still fight by my side.</string>
        <string _locid="38836">To express my gratitude for rescuing our explorer I shall have a new sapling planted in the Black Forest.</string>
        <string _locid="38837">My troops have destroyed a trading post. We are no longer threatened by defeat in that manner.</string>
        <string _locid="38838">The natives in this realm have been freed by my decisive action.</string>
        <string _locid="38839">This opponent has lost a town to my army. Unfortunate for him, but only to be expected.</string>
        <string _locid="38840">Not surprisingly, I have destroyed another enemy building. In this case, on a trade site.</string>
        <string _locid="38841">I tried to free those natives but was waylaid.</string>
        <string _locid="38842">The enemy town was not razed by my forces. I may need a new stratagem.</string>
        <string _locid="38843">I regret to inform you that my assault on that trading post failed.</string>
        <string _locid="38844">My explorer is down and therefore cannot gather treasures. We may have to increase our efforts in other areas until he is rescued.</string>
        <string _locid="38845">The New World holds a variety of dangers. My explorer has fallen even though off the battlefield.</string>
        <string _locid="38846">In the face of this storm, I believe we have met our match.</string>
        <string _locid="38847">Request military assistance here immediately.</string>
        <string _locid="38848">Alert, my ally! Enemy forces are at my gates.</string>
        <string _locid="38849">Bayonets are at our throats! I need assistance in my town now!</string>
        <string _locid="38850">Request to bring your army to the aid of my town at once!</string>
        <string _locid="38851">Your presence lends a dignity to our alliance.</string>
        <string _locid="38852">It shall be an honor to fight by your side.</string>
        <string _locid="38853">Together we shall present a terrifying sight to our enemy's gaze.</string>
        <string _locid="38854">For this alliance I predict only victory and glory.</string>
        <string _locid="38855">Our alliance in this conflict will clearly result in the destruction of our foes.</string>
        <string _locid="38856">Together we will present a storm of destruction for our enemies.</string>
        <string _locid="38857">Ah, the challenge is increasing. It approaches a level worthy of my genius.</string>
        <string _locid="38858">The challenge has been reduced. One hemisphere of my superior brain can take a vacation and we will still be triumphant.</string>
        <string _locid="38859">As a foe you earned my respect. I trust you will display similar talent as my ally.</string>
        <string _locid="38860">You showed exceptional promise in our last battle. Together our combined brilliance will vanquish any enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="38861">Although you had little hope of defeating me in our prior encounter, as an ally you now have an opportunity to observe my genius directly.</string>
        <string _locid="38862">This time, remember this if nothing else: He who defends everything defends nothing.</string>
        <string _locid="38863">I see fate has thrown us again into the same territory of the New World.</string>
        <string _locid="38864">Perhaps this time we should make this agreement: you are to request what you please, and I am to do what I please.</string>
        <string _locid="38865">As in our previous victory, no matter the outcome, I will continue to think, live, and die as a king.</string>
        <string _locid="38866">I elected to ransom my explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="38867">Not surprisingly, the enemy was unable to stop me from rescuing my explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="38868">I have gained visibility to an enemy base. Can you comprehend that there is no army defending it?</string>
        <string _locid="38869">One of our enemy's bases has no barracks.</string>
        <string _locid="38870">Be informed that an enemy town is devoid of a stable.</string>
        <string _locid="38871">I expect this coin to be used prudently.</string>
        <string _locid="38872">Take this food and make sure each soldier gets some.</string>
        <string _locid="38873">Some of this wood comes from the Black Forest, but all of it is useful to our cause.</string>
        <string _locid="38874">I've given the order to attack here.</string>
        <string _locid="38875">Our enemy's economy is a weak point, so I intend to raid settlers now.</string>
        <string _locid="38876">I have issued the command to attack the main town immediately.</string>
        <string _locid="38877">These natives will be grateful to ally with us after I free them from our enemies.</string>
        <string _locid="38878">My forces are on their way to attack this trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="38879">Continue your assault; I have sent troops to assist you against the trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="38880">This is an strategic place for a military base. I shall build one.</string>
        <string _locid="38881">A town center will be constructed here by my settlers.</string>
        <string _locid="38882">Note that I am pursing the construction of a trading post at this native village.</string>
        <string _locid="38883">I know of a trading site that would be improved with a German flag over it.</string>
        <string _locid="38884">A regiment of my forces have been assigned to defend this building.</string>
        <string _locid="38885">Some of my forces will protect this location.</string>
        <string _locid="38886">These natives and their village are under my protection.</string>
        <string _locid="38887">It would be foolish to let this town fall, so I will not allow it.</string>
        <string _locid="38888">I refuse to relinquish this trading post to the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="38889">Expect coin to flow steadily from my coffers into yours.</string>
        <string _locid="38890">I will continue to send you food, and also sauerkraut.</string>
        <string _locid="38891">I will send a steady supply of food to you.</string>
        <string _locid="38892">Expect food to continue arriving from me.</string>
        <string _locid="38893">You need food to keep fighting, so I will keep sending it.</string>
        <string _locid="38894">Here is some wood. Expect continual shipments of more from me.</string>
        <string _locid="38895">My troops are on their way.</string>
        <string _locid="38896">Do not mistake my recent lack of correspondence as a lack of resolve to decimate our opponent!</string>
        <string _locid="38897">Please tribute me coin for an immediate need I have.</string>
        <string _locid="38898">Request that you tribute me food.</string>
        <string _locid="38899">I have a request that you tribute me wood.</string>
        <string _locid="38900">Your contribution to that assault was bold, and greatly appreciated.</string>
        <string _locid="38901">Thank you for the coin.</string>
        <string _locid="38902">I thank you for your tribute of food.</string>
        <string _locid="38903">My base may have been badly damaged if you had not come to my defense.</string>
        <string _locid="38904">The resources you tributed to my empire are greatly appreciated.</string>
        <string _locid="38905">The wood you sent me will be well used, thank you.</string>
        <string _locid="38906">What a mighty foe the British have proven to be.</string>
        <string _locid="38907">The Dutch are overpowering us.</string>
        <string _locid="38908">The might of the French cannot be denied here.</string>
        <string _locid="38909">Whatever the Ottomans are doing, they are doing it well enough to hand us our hats.</string>
        <string _locid="38910">I do not know if we will be able to stand up to the Ottoman advance.</string>
        <string _locid="38911">The Portuguese have proven powerful adversaries. Things are looking dark for us.</string>
        <string _locid="38912">The Russians have been powerful foes in this battle. I fear perhaps too powerful.</string>
        <string _locid="38913">What have the Spanish done to become so mighty? I doubt we will be able to stop them.</string>
        <string _locid="38914">Consider this: we are losing, but among our opponents, the weakest is the British.</string>
        <string _locid="38915">I perceive we may lose if we don't counter-attack soon. I suggest the Dutch, who are clearly weaker.</string>
        <string _locid="38916">Although we fade, we must strike at their weakness, the French.</string>
        <string _locid="38917">As I am not leading them, our weakest foe is German. I suggest we strike at them before we are defeated ourselves.</string>
        <string _locid="38918">The war is going in their favor. Shall we strike their weakness, the Portuguese?</string>
        <string _locid="38919">If we don't attack the Russians soon we may be defeated.</string>
        <string _locid="38920">I will not yield defeat willingly, but if we do not attack the Spanish soon I may be forced to.</string>
        <string _locid="38921">You are a superb strategician. In this rare case, perhaps even better than I.</string>
        <string _locid="38922">I regret not having shared more of my superior capabilities with you during this battle. If I had, we might not be losing.</string>
        <string _locid="38923">Continue to thrust forward! Great guns are the most respectable argument of the rights of kings.</string>
        <string _locid="38924">Your great army and my superior intellect shall together vanquish our foes.</string>
        <string _locid="38925">As an ally you have been useful in my conquering of the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="38926">Things are not looking good for us, I fear.</string>
        <string _locid="38927">It does not take a military genius to see we've lost.</string>
        <string _locid="38928">There is no point in continuing this conflict; we have lost!</string>
        <string _locid="38929">Quickly, choose a trading post to attack and we will strike it together!</string>
        <string _locid="38930">The enemy has allied with some natives. A laughable plan at best.</string>
        <string _locid="38931">The enemy has overextended his position by claiming a trade site too early.</string>
        <string _locid="38932">The enemy has more native allies than we do. We should move to change that.</string>
        <string _locid="38933">Our foe seeks trade strength. Our military strength has a reply for that.</string>
        <string _locid="38934">Your alliance with the natives in this New World was bold. I like that.</string>
        <string _locid="38935">The trade route you are exploiting should serve us well, both in battle and after we claim victory!</string>
        <string _locid="38936">Impressive. You understand that even small advances can help in our quest for victory.</string>
        <string _locid="38937">A first small step toward triumph.</string>
        <string _locid="38938">You are wise to add to your supplies any way you can.</string>
        <string _locid="38939">Another small boost to your coffers.</string>
        <string _locid="38940">Soldiers cannot eat their boots. At least not usually.</string>
        <string _locid="38941">Although you have collected more treasures than I have, my base has expanded boldly.</string>
        <string _locid="38942">You have proven yourself a collector. Hopefully next, a warrior.</string>
        <string _locid="38943">Where is the gain to our alliance, your collecting treasures so close to my town?</string>
        <string _locid="38944">The treasures near my base should be left for my explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="38945">The native warriors you have befriended will give us an edge.</string>
        <string _locid="38946">Each settler you have working for you is an advantage our foes will rue.</string>
        <string _locid="38947">More wood for you means less wood for them.</string>
        <string _locid="38948">Excellent move. We now have more native allies than our foe.</string>
        <string _locid="38949">We move that much closer to controlling all trade in this area.</string>
        <string _locid="38950">Be certain you incorporate your walls into an overall strategy of offense.</string>
        <string _locid="38951">You will note I have allied with a native village in the New World. Another brilliant maneuver.</string>
        <string _locid="38952">My decisive action in claiming a trade site will help us achieve victory.</string>
        <string _locid="38953">A treasure has been claimed and secured by me.</string>
        <string _locid="38954">The New World has yielded coin for my coffers.</string>
        <string _locid="38955">It may not be sauerkraut, but it will help fill my soldier's bellies.</string>
        <string _locid="38956">As the superior strategician, you'll appreciate that any treasure I gain helps us both.</string>
        <string _locid="38957">You are not exploiting the advantages of the New World effectively; gather more treasures.</string>
        <string _locid="38958">Native warriors are welcome additions to my army.</string>
        <string _locid="38959">Another settler has elected to serve under the German flag.</string>
        <string _locid="38960">I can use wood. Even wood will have a small role to play in our eventual win.</string>
        <string _locid="38961">Thanks to my efforts, we have another native ally.</string>
        <string _locid="38962">I have claimed a trading site. I encourage you to increase your own contribution to our alliance.</string>
        <string _locid="38963">I am constructing walls to shelter my economy while my military expands.</string>
        <string _locid="38964">Our bold strategy may yet pay off; we now hold four of a kind.</string>
        <string _locid="38965">Do not let your reduced rating discourage you. After all, a crown is merely a hat that lets the rain in.</string>
        <string _locid="38966">Your increased rating indicates you are one to let your actions speak for you.</string>
        <string _locid="38967">At the rate you are gaining experience, the day may come in which I ask you for military advice myself.</string>
        <string _locid="38968">I admire opposition that has conviction, but in less than one minute I will be the one convinced.</string>
        <string _locid="38969">I observe that in one minute I will lose this battle. You have my respect.</string>
        <string _locid="38970">It will all be over very soon, and I am forced to admit your superiority in this battle.</string>
        <string _locid="38971">Every warrior must accept defeat eventually, at least every warrior I meet.</string>
        <string _locid="38972">You should deem it an honor to have been defeated by me.</string>
        <string _locid="38973">In one minute your cause will be utterly defeated.</string>
        <string _locid="38974">Several opponents engage at once here, but my soldiers are doubtlessly the best trained.</string>
        <string _locid="38975">There are soldiers from several armies fighting here. Another glorious fray.</string>
        <string _locid="38976">I'll begin by taking. Scholars later shall demonstrate my perfect right to have done so.</string>
        <string _locid="38977">As we face off before battle, I can only say I am grateful I am not you.</string>
        <string _locid="38978">I am called Frederick the Great. Can there be any question as to the outcome of this battle?</string>
        <string _locid="38979">The battle has only just engaged but already your only reasonable options are retreat or surrender.</string>
        <string _locid="38980">My forces are dominant and my strategy superior; how can you defeat me?</string>
        <string _locid="38981">Great guns, and the timely arrival of an ally, are the most respectable arguments of the rights of kings.</string>
        <string _locid="38982">The battle is turning in my favor.</string>
        <string _locid="38983">My ally has arrived! Together we shall decimate your forces.</string>
        <string _locid="38984">Beware, my foe! My battalions are strengthened by my ally!</string>
        <string _locid="38985">Your ally saved you in this battle.</string>
        <string _locid="38986">I curse your luck. If not for your ally's arrival I would have smashed your army in this battle!</string>
        <string _locid="38987">This battle is slipping from my grasp!</string>
        <string _locid="38988">It is only because your ally has arrived in time with reinforcements that you are winning this fight.</string>
        <string _locid="38989">Your skill in advancing is plain. How you will use that to your advantage is not, likely not even to you.</string>
        <string _locid="38990">I see you have advanced to the next Age. It's a pity you can't advance your military talents as easily.</string>
        <string _locid="38991">You have squandered your resources advancing to the next Age so quickly, nothing more.</string>
        <string _locid="38992">It is not that your have beat me in reaching a higher Age, it is that I have displayed superior patience.</string>
        <string _locid="38993">Your decision to gain native allies was wise. How you will utilize them will no doubt be foolish.</string>
        <string _locid="38994">Losing that trading post was a setback, but no more.</string>
        <string _locid="38995">An effective commander utilizes all of the resources available to him. I assure you that that town center was only a small element of my arsenal.</string>
        <string _locid="38996">I suppose you think the loss of my town center will affect my military machine, but I assure you it will not.</string>
        <string _locid="38997">A town center may be the heart of a leader's base, but a wise commander ... well, I suppose losing it stinks however I cut it.</string>
        <string _locid="38998">Curse it -- my town center was the only decent source of bratwurst in the whole New World!</string>
        <string _locid="38999">That town center was essential to the gestalt of my base.</string>
        <string _locid="39000">You fool; the finest biergarten and lager on this whole continent were inside that town center!</string>
        <string _locid="39001">Flattening my town center has filled me with angst. </string>
        <string _locid="39002">The destruction of that trading post has served only to focus my attention on wiping your empire from the New World.</string>
        <string _locid="39003">A kindergartener could have seen that attack coming.</string>
        <string _locid="39004">Do you think destroying that trade site will lead to your victory? You probably also claim to see poltergeists.</string>
        <string _locid="39005">You are like a lammergeier, a cowardly vulture attacking my trade sites when I am not prepared to defend them.</string>
        <string _locid="39006">Are you waiting until I arrive with the army of the apocalypse before advancing to the Colonial Age?</string>
        <string _locid="39007">Do you plan to advance to the Colonial Age after your kaffeeklatsch? </string>
        <string _locid="39008">Apparently Oktoberfest will come and go before you reach the Colonial Age.</string>
        <string _locid="39009">My schnauzer could dog paddle to the New World faster than you advance through the Ages. </string>
        <string _locid="39010">Your empire is advancing so slowly you might have more luck if you sent settlers to the front lines with rakes.</string>
        <string _locid="39011">You are taking so long to advance, perhaps you should just pack your whole town up in a wagon and send it back to the old world.</string>
        <string _locid="39012">It does not take an ubermensch to take an empire to the Colonial Age!</string>
        <string _locid="39013">Among all combatants, you have reached the Colonial Age first. Surely you do not expect that move alone to save you.</string>
        <string _locid="39014">Your quick advancement to the Colonial Age fills me with weltschmerz.</string>
        <string _locid="39015">If your strategy is to advance your empire as slowly as possible so as to weaken us with laughter, you are succeeding.</string>
        <string _locid="39016">Is your empire hitched to a slug?</string>
        <string _locid="39017">Your slow rise to the second Age indicates you have little wille zur macht. </string>
        <string _locid="39018">I see you have finally joined the rest of us in the Colonial Age.</string>
        <string _locid="39019">You are rather separated from your allies. Perhaps you better begin shouting for help now.</string>
        <string _locid="39020">Do you expect the poor placement of your town center to allow you more time to practice your harpsichord?</string>
        <string _locid="39021">It is helpful that your towns are closely packed. We will raze them all as one.</string>
        <string _locid="39022">Your towns are huddled together like frightened rabbits in a pen.</string>
        <string _locid="39023">I have destroyed a trading post and ended your attempt at an unusual victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39024">I enjoyed destroying that trading post even more than usual.</string>
        <string _locid="39025">That stops your rather pathetic effort to snatch victory from the approaching jaws of defeat.</string>
        <string _locid="39026">That trading post should not have been built on my continent anyway.</string>
        <string _locid="39027">Believe me, the natives will be much happier allying with my empire than yours.</string>
        <string _locid="39028">I hope you weren't going to use that town center.</string>
        <string _locid="39029">Don't feel too bad. Where your town center stood I plan to construct a nice strudel stand.</string>
        <string _locid="39030">Your town center put up as mighty a fight as a she-dachshund.</string>
        <string _locid="39031">I have crushed your town center just as I planned.</string>
        <string _locid="39032">Your town center has fallen and the rest of your base will soon follow it.</string>
        <string _locid="39033">With your town center destroyed I imagine you now feel a great wanderlust.</string>
        <string _locid="39034">I'm sorry I destroyed your town center. Well, no, not really.</string>
        <string _locid="39035">Perhaps you can build another town center. I could use some more practice destroying them.</string>
        <string _locid="39036">I removed the trading post you had carelessly built on my trading route.</string>
        <string _locid="39037">That trading post was obstructing my plans to conquer the New World.</string>
        <string _locid="39038">You didn't really need that trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="39039">Why did you build a trading post in the middle of my empire anyway?</string>
        <string _locid="39040">I tire of inept opposition. Bring your best or just have your resignation delivered now.</string>
        <string _locid="39041">Greetings. Prepare to be destroyed.</string>
        <string _locid="39042">I am Frederick the Great. I cannot imagine why you dare to challenge me.</string>
        <string _locid="39043">This New World looks like it will make a good new Germany, don't you think?</string>
        <string _locid="39044">I can only hope you will not collapse before my assault as easily as my last foe.</string>
        <string _locid="39045">Note to my opponent: this land belongs to me.</string>
        <string _locid="39046">Welcome to the New World. My New World.</string>
        <string _locid="39047">I am not interested in fighting. Only in winning.</string>
        <string _locid="39048">I toyed with war in the prior conflict. Now I will bring my full powers to bear.</string>
        <string _locid="39049">I am glad to see you expect a greater challenge this time. I assure you I will bring one.</string>
        <string _locid="39050">It is good that you seek a great challenge. I have yet to find even a mild one.</string>
        <string _locid="39051">I grasp that you want more of a challenge. Too bad you will not also be grasping victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39052">I will give my brilliance a vacation. You will face only ordinary genius this time.</string>
        <string _locid="39053">I see you seek a less overwhelming match. I hope you won't mind if I eat some bratwurst while we do battle.</string>
        <string _locid="39054">I cannot fault you for seeking to reduce the challenge, considering your opponent is me.</string>
        <string _locid="39055">This battle should be a little easier to deal with. I'll tie one army behind my back.</string>
        <string _locid="39056">We do battle in the same region of the New World as our prior conflict.</string>
        <string _locid="39057">The odds are less stacked against you this time. I'll try not to punish you too severely.</string>
        <string _locid="39058">Although the odds are stacked in my favor do not expect mercy from Frederick the Great.</string>
        <string _locid="39059">I am surprised you think you can defend against both me and an ally. I look forward to proving you very wrong.</string>
        <string _locid="39060">These odds are more like it. I'm going to enjoy paving over your town with my empire.</string>
        <string _locid="39061">These odds seem a bit extreme in my favor. No matter, I will show you again how war is fought.</string>
        <string _locid="39062">Odds are stacked against you. If this is the way you prefer to be destroyed, fine by me.</string>
        <string _locid="39063">You were careless. I rescued my explorer out from beneath your nose.</string>
        <string _locid="39064">My explorer has been rescued and tells me you are ripe to conquer.</string>
        <string _locid="39065">Your explorer has been spotted by my forces. Why don't you just hide him behind your town center.</string>
        <string _locid="39066">There is your first army. It is more pathetic than I expected.</string>
        <string _locid="39067">It doesn't surprise me that your soldiers appear to be lost.</string>
        <string _locid="39068">You may wish to round up your small wandering army before I do it for you.</string>
        <string _locid="39069">I see that squad of soldiers scouting for my base. I will write off a snippy letter to Voltaire if you persist.</string>
        <string _locid="39070">Take it from a true military genius: you should have brought a real army.</string>
        <string _locid="39071">Are your soldiers wandering near my town center because they like bratwurst? I can't imagine any other reason they would.</string>
        <string _locid="39072">Although I understand your wanting to avoid my soldiers, you embarrass yourself attacking my civilians.</string>
        <string _locid="39073">Stop attacking my settlers.</string>
        <string _locid="39074">Don't make my settlers mad. You won't like them when they're mad.</string>
        <string _locid="39075">Somehow you've managed to mistake my settlers for my army. Kindly back off until my actual soldiers arrive.</string>
        <string _locid="39076">This large army of yours appears confused and leaderless. No, correction, I see it is being commanded by you.</string>
        <string _locid="39077">That's a large army you have assembled. Poorly trained and badly equipped no doubt, but large.</string>
        <string _locid="39078">I advise moving the large army walking through my empire to the nearest rubbish heap, where they will feel more at home.</string>
        <string _locid="39079">Is that an army entering my area? I'm surprised you could convince that many soldiers to fight under your banner.</string>
        <string _locid="39080">I see you have sent a group of targets for my troops.</string>
        <string _locid="39081">What do you plan to do with that band of ruffians you call soldiers? Gather truffles?</string>
        <string _locid="39082">You were cruel to send those soldiers marching off to their doom.</string>
        <string _locid="39083">Why do you have a cluster of soldiers wandering around in the middle of nowhere?</string>
        <string _locid="39084">I suppose you might call that pathetic group of soldiers an army, but I wouldn't.</string>
        <string _locid="39085">Have you sent those soldiers into the wilderness to punish them? </string>
        <string _locid="39086">How did you assemble such a potent force?</string>
        <string _locid="39087">Your army is worthy of ... well, me. Not good.</string>
        <string _locid="39088">Your army has lost its way. It should be back in your town, defending it.</string>
        <string _locid="39089">If I were facing true military skill I might actually be worried at this point.</string>
        <string _locid="39090">You may want to recover the small group of deserters fleeing through my empire. Oh, I'm sorry, was that your army?</string>
        <string _locid="39091">I can only imagine those soldiers you have sent into the wilderness are trying to find their way home.</string>
        <string _locid="39092">Why do you have a tiny army doing nothing in the middle of nowhere? Do you call that a strategy?</string>
        <string _locid="39093">You appear to have some soldiers lost in my empire. Remove them before I am forced to.</string>
        <string _locid="39094">It is always a joy to discover my opponent's base. The anticipation of razing it comes more clearly into focus.</string>
        <string _locid="39095">I see your town center. You may want to take one last look at it yourself.</string>
        <string _locid="39096">I've spotted your town center. It will make a lovely crater.</string>
        <string _locid="39097">Is that your town center I see? Nice of you to place it directly in the path of my conquering army.</string>
        <string _locid="39098">You wasted your ammunition. Everything in the New World belongs to me.</string>
        <string _locid="39099">That small fight is but a microcosm of the great battles, and results, to come.</string>
        <string _locid="39100">I am not surprised I took that treasure, but I am surprised you thought you might beat me to it.</string>
        <string _locid="39101">Another treasure for me, another beating for you.</string>
        <string _locid="39102">Would you like three guesses as to whose army is here? Ah, but you'll be too busy dying to play games.</string>
        <string _locid="39103">You will be overjoyed to hear that my exceptionally well trained German army has arrived to fight you.</string>
        <string _locid="39104">I look forward to this battle, but my soldiers hunger for it.</string>
        <string _locid="39105">My troops have arrived. I pity yours.</string>
        <string _locid="39106">I have not heard from you in awhile. I can only imagine you are spending your time knitting caps.</string>
        <string _locid="39107">Are you waiting to attack, or are you just contemplating surrender?</string>
        <string _locid="39108">It has been so long since I've seen any activity from you I imagine you may have forgotten we are at war. My army will be happy to remind you.</string>
        <string _locid="39109">Your empire is awfully quiet. Have your soldiers traded their weapons for hoes?</string>
        <string _locid="39110">Witness my mastery of the flute! Well, that, and my skills in warfare, of course.</string>
        <string _locid="39113">My empire has been defeated. I offer my surrender.</string>
        <string _locid="39114">It does not take a genius to recognize I am defeated. I request to resign.</string>
        <string _locid="39115">You may have stopped me on one front, but there are other ways to win.</string>
        <string _locid="39116">I see you have taken the lead in recruiting native allies. Victory will still be mine.</string>
        <string _locid="39117">Gaining one more trading post will not make a difference. You will still be defeated.</string>
        <string _locid="39118">You have taken the lead on collecting trade sites, but I assure you it will make no difference in the end.</string>
        <string _locid="39119">You have collected a New World treasure, but there is more to winning a war than that. </string>
        <string _locid="39120">Does finding goodies please you? Crushing empires pleases me.</string>
        <string _locid="39121">A few coins in your coffers will hardly improve your chances against my ravaging armies.</string>
        <string _locid="39122">Enjoy the food you just found. Soon enough all you'll have to eat is sauerkraut.</string>
        <string _locid="39123">Your focus is on collecting treasures. Mine is on building an unstoppable military empire.</string>
        <string _locid="39124">That treasure belonged to me. I'll recover the slight by razing your town.</string>
        <string _locid="39125">I feel sorry for any natives you have fooled into joining you.</string>
        <string _locid="39126">Why don't you just send your new settler back to the old world, where it's safe.</string>
        <string _locid="39127">That wood you just found could be used to build a nice raft. Maybe you could try to escape my New World on it.</string>
        <string _locid="39128">Ah, walls. Like the crunchy outer coating to a delightful German chocolate.</string>
        <string _locid="39129">Would it interest you to learn I have allied with natives of this New World? Perhaps not, you are still learning how to boil water.</string>
        <string _locid="39130">I have the first trading post. You, however, have ... well, nothing significant at all.</string>
        <string _locid="39131">Another treasure on the New World is mine.</string>
        <string _locid="39132">One more treasure for me, one less for you. Fitting, really.</string>
        <string _locid="39133">A treasure has granted me more coin. As if I needed it.</string>
        <string _locid="39134">This food tastes good. You can be certain I won't be sharing it with you.</string>
        <string _locid="39135">Why did you leave a treasure unclaimed so near your town? It is mine now.</string>
        <string _locid="39136">Even I am slightly surprised that you have been so poor at collecting treasures. </string>
        <string _locid="39137">The natives are clearly more intelligent than you are; they are allying with me.</string>
        <string _locid="39138">Another settler has joined my empire. I am doing everything I can to reduce the time you suffer before you fall.</string>
        <string _locid="39139">More wood for me. I am gaining everything I need for a swift victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39140">While you gather alliances with natives, my empire prepares to build cannon.</string>
        <string _locid="39141">You may have found a foothold on the trading route, but will that really help you when my armies storm your empire?</string>
        <string _locid="39142">I admire your strategy. It won't bring you victory, but I admire it.</string>
        <string _locid="39143">I hope you remember how to get back to the Old World. The New World will soon belong to me.</string>
        <string _locid="39144">Your rating has dropped precipitously. Think of our next confrontation as a clinic.</string>
        <string _locid="39145">In this battle I will whip your hindquarters almost as hard as my father whipped mine, when I dared to write poetry!</string>
        <string _locid="39146">How did you increase your rating that much? I can only assume bribery.</string>
        <string _locid="39147">I see that your rating has increased a great deal since last we met. It will be all the more enjoyable to flatten you.</string>
        <string _locid="39148">Your rating is higher, but your choices in battle will no doubt be just as predictable as before.</string>
        <string _locid="39149">How nice that you have increased your rating. On my side, I look forward to increasing my victory count by one.</string>
        <string _locid="39150">You have gained much experience since we met last, but I doubt you'll be able to apply it toward a victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39151">I suppose you are proud to have earned some more experience since we last met. It is the last you'll ever get.</string>
        <string _locid="39152">You've collected a lot more experience since we met last. I hope you will apply it to providing me with some small challenge.</string>
        <string _locid="39153">Ah, I see your experience has increased. Too bad you cannot buy military ability with it.</string>
        <string _locid="39154">You go down with the ship. I will escape with the women and children.</string>
        <string _locid="39155">Which Mediterranean island will you retire to once these swine have been conquered?</string>
        <string _locid="39156">The new heavy artillery are miracles of modern science. You should give them a shot.</string>
        <string _locid="39157">For centuries cavalry have led the charges of battle ... where did your horses run off to?</string>
        <string _locid="39158">Even the most degraded commoner knows wars cannot be won without infantry!</string>
        <string _locid="39159">It would be foolish to fight under these conditions.</string>
        <string _locid="39160">Let us save our strength for another fight.</string>
        <string _locid="39161">This will be a battle the poets will tell of for many years.</string>
        <string _locid="39162">My fears have been made whole. The heathen have bested us.</string>
        <string _locid="39165">They won! I am absolutely flabbergasted.</string>
        <string _locid="39166">Now that our foes have been eradicated we can move on to more important political matters.</string>
        <string _locid="39167">As I suspected, the enemy forces are broken.</string>
        <string _locid="39169">That was a close one!</string>
        <string _locid="39170">Our alliance will prove certain victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39171">My strategists predict a victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39172">Pretty sure I've got this one under control.</string>
        <string _locid="39173">Your reinforcements have arrived just in time.</string>
        <string _locid="39174">Look! Those heretical warmongers have recruited help from their allies.</string>
        <string _locid="39175">Good thinking.</string>
        <string _locid="39176">Alright.</string>
        <string _locid="39177">Excellent idea! Artillery is just what we need.</string>
        <string _locid="39178">Very good. Artillery with cavalry support will certainly pave the road to our victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39179">A wise choice. Artillery and infantry are the backbone of any successful army.</string>
        <string _locid="39180">Right. I will bolster our forces with cavalry.</string>
        <string _locid="39181">When the enemy hears my storm of thundering hooves and crashing cannonballs, they will surely flee for their lives.</string>
        <string _locid="39182">Yes I think that will work splendidly. Infantry and cavalry make a very strong combination.</string>
        <string _locid="39183">Well then, I shall flood the battlefields with legions of infantry.</string>
        <string _locid="39185">The enemy will surely be at our mercy of our crusading infantry and noble steeds.</string>
        <string _locid="39186">I regret to say my strained economy simply cannot bear such a burden.</string>
        <string _locid="39187">Unfortunately I have spent too much money on wine, women, and song to afford that.</string>
        <string _locid="39188">Regretfully, I must decline.</string>
        <string _locid="39189">I wish I could, but I cannot.</string>
        <string _locid="39190">My army is non-existent. There is nothing I can do.</string>
        <string _locid="39191">That is beyond God's will and simply impossible for me to do.</string>
        <string _locid="39192">Until I can recruit more troops, I'm afraid I cannot help.</string>
        <string _locid="39193">Those blasted dogs have destroyed our monopoly!</string>
        <string _locid="39194">It seems we have nearly forced the British back to their puny island.</string>
        <string _locid="39195">The Dutch are nearly defeated. Perhaps we should send them some sympathy tulips. </string>
        <string _locid="39196">I cannot say I am sad to see the French go.</string>
        <string _locid="39197">Our alliance has proved stronger than the German nation.</string>
        <string _locid="39199">It looks as if we have defeated the insurgent Portuguese rebellion.</string>
        <string _locid="39200">Superb. Our alliance has outlasted the Russian forces.</string>
        <string _locid="39201">The Spanish simply did not have the political foresight to last out this war.</string>
        <string _locid="39202">England is proving to be a formidable adversary.</string>
        <string _locid="39203">The Dutch are growing quite powerful, we must choose our actions carefully.</string>
        <string _locid="39204">The French frighten me with their mighty empire.</string>
        <string _locid="39205">The German Reich must be stopped before they become too dangerous.</string>
        <string _locid="39207">We have let the Portuguese dissenters build their empire unchecked. Now, I fear they will wage a ruthless civil war.</string>
        <string _locid="39208">My political connections inform me that we should be wary of the Russians.</string>
        <string _locid="39209">How could we have let the Spanish forces grow to such proportions?</string>
        <string _locid="39210">Your nation's scientific progress is outstanding! I can only hope my nation will follow in your footsteps.</string>
        <string _locid="39211">Very very impressive. I should be advancing shortly.</string>
        <string _locid="39212">The natives are restless ... and what is worse, they are allied with the enemy!</string>
        <string _locid="39213">This could be bad. The enemy has recruited the natives for aid.</string>
        <string _locid="39214">You doing OK there chief?</string>
        <string _locid="39215">Scientific progress is a glorious thing, perhaps you should consider aging up.</string>
        <string _locid="39216">I would feel much more secure about our alliance if you were aging up a bit faster.</string>
        <string _locid="39217">Excellent work my friend. Now we must recruit an army.</string>
        <string _locid="39218">You're off to a great start. Keep at it.</string>
        <string _locid="39219">Savoring the flavor of the Age would be dandy if we didn't have a war on our hands!</string>
        <string _locid="39220">Glad to see you made it to the Colonial Age.</string>
        <string _locid="39221">Thank you for rescuing my explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="39222">My explorer is thankful. Let me know if I can return the favor.</string>
        <string _locid="39223">Nice to see you've rescued my explorer. I'll put him back to exploring immediately.</string>
        <string _locid="39224">Rejoice. The monopoly has been broken.</string>
        <string _locid="39225">I have shown the natives the error of their ways. They will no longer help the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="39226">I have freed the natives from the bondage of our enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="39227">I'm pleased to inform you that I have sacked one of the enemies towns.</string>
        <string _locid="39228">See the ashes floating up? That is all that remains of an enemy town.</string>
        <string _locid="39229">Count this as an economic victory for us.</string>
        <string _locid="39230">The enemy's trade route fell easily under my sword.</string>
        <string _locid="39231">Damnation! The natives must be using black magic. My attack has failed.</string>
        <string _locid="39232">Their forces were too much. Hopefully the next attack will swing in our favor.</string>
        <string _locid="39233">No doubt my attack failed because my troops bartered their guns at the trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="39234">My explorer is slain! </string>
        <string _locid="39235">No! I have lost my explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="39236">Cougars and bison and bears, oh my.</string>
        <string _locid="39237">My explorer has been eaten by the wilderness.</string>
        <string _locid="39238">I have lost my troops, my economy, and my will to fight. I'm afraid I must be resigning soon.</string>
        <string _locid="39239">We put up a good fight, but it looks as if we should be resigning soon. Don't you think?</string>
        <string _locid="39240">I could use some help here.</string>
        <string _locid="39241">Send what you can to help fight please.</string>
        <string _locid="39242">To arms, to arms! My base is under siege.</string>
        <string _locid="39243">They have me surrounded. I will do what I can, but I am greatly in need of your troops.</string>
        <string _locid="39244">Things are looking pretty grim over here. If you don't send some aid soon, I'm done for.</string>
        <string _locid="39245">Pleased to make your alliance.</string>
        <string _locid="39246">I am sure we'll make an excellent team.</string>
        <string _locid="39247">This will be a challenge, I hope we prevail.</string>
        <string _locid="39248">This may not be as challenging as before. Surely we will be victorious.</string>
        <string _locid="39249">Last time we faced each other, you proved your merit in battle. I am glad to see we're allies this time.</string>
        <string _locid="39250">It seems we are allies again. This time I shall strive to pull my weight.</string>
        <string _locid="39251">I hope you prove to be a better ally than opponent.</string>
        <string _locid="39252">Not you again!</string>
        <string _locid="39253">This terrain looks mighty familiar, no?</string>
        <string _locid="39254">Last time we were disgraced in battle. Lets see to it we are the victors this time around.</string>
        <string _locid="39255">Ugh! My head still hurts from celebrating our last victory!</string>
        <string _locid="39256">The good news is I have my explorer back. The bad news is they charged me a hefty ransom.</string>
        <string _locid="39257">Huzzah! I have rescued my explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="39258">The enemy's troops must be drinking at the tavern. Now is the time to strike their main base.</string>
        <string _locid="39259">The enemy has no barracks. If you were to send in some cavalry they couldn't even muster a single pikeman.</string>
        <string _locid="39260">Look what I've found: a stableless town. Artillery would be perfect right now.</string>
        <string _locid="39261">Don't spend this all on ale.</string>
        <string _locid="39262">Put this money to good use.</string>
        <string _locid="39263">Eat to live, and not live to eat.</string>
        <string _locid="39264">Your settlers look mighty thin, perhaps they could use some food.</string>
        <string _locid="39265">Use this timber to your advantage.</string>
        <string _locid="39266">This lumber should help strengthen your town's infrastructure.</string>
        <string _locid="39267">I shall send my soldiers to the enemy front.</string>
        <string _locid="39268">I am going to attack the enemy base now.</string>
        <string _locid="39269">If the enemy has any unprotected gatherers I will hunt them down.</string>
        <string _locid="39270">As we speak my troops are readying themselves to strike at the heart of the enemy's base.</string>
        <string _locid="39271">My troops are preparing to ravage the enemy's main base.</string>
        <string _locid="39272">I will take care of these pesky natives.</string>
        <string _locid="39273">I will deprive the enemy of his liquor by destroying this trade site.</string>
        <string _locid="39274">I am coming to your aid.</string>
        <string _locid="39275">My troops are on the way!</string>
        <string _locid="39276">I will be right there.</string>
        <string _locid="39277">I'm going to set up military operations in this area.</string>
        <string _locid="39278">This will be the site of my next town. I think I shall christen it with your name.</string>
        <string _locid="39279">I have decided to build my next town center approximately right here.</string>
        <string _locid="39280">For only a few beads these natives will gladly aid us in our war.</string>
        <string _locid="39281">I've decided it's time to get the locals involved in our fight.</string>
        <string _locid="39282">A trade post here will ensure plenty of wine to give our soldiers spirit.</string>
        <string _locid="39283">Just to let you know, I'll be building a trading post here.</string>
        <string _locid="39284">On my mother's honor, this building shall not fall.</string>
        <string _locid="39285">This location is essential to our success. I shall defend it.</string>
        <string _locid="39286">The enemy is trying to oppress our natives, they must be protected!</string>
        <string _locid="39287">We shall make a stand in this town.</string>
        <string _locid="39288">They are trying to take our source of imported wine! We must defend this trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="39289">My coffers are overflowing with wealth. I happily share it with you.</string>
        <string _locid="39290">Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Give a man a boatload of fish and he will eat for a damn long time.</string>
        <string _locid="39291">Shiver me timbers, I will give you more wood.</string>
        <string _locid="39292">Keep up the fighting, I'm on my way.</string>
        <string _locid="39293">My forces are en route.</string>
        <string _locid="39294">Hold the line, reinforcements are on the way.</string>
        <string _locid="39295">So ... drink any good ale lately?</string>
        <string _locid="39296">You must be one of the strong silent types.</string>
        <string _locid="39297">Checking your email?</string>
        <string _locid="39298">Alms for the poor? My friend, I am in need of some coin.</string>
        <string _locid="39299">Could you spare a few coins for a loyal ally?</string>
        <string _locid="39300">There are starving children in my land. Can you provide some food?</string>
        <string _locid="39301">My soldiers have been reduced to eating their shoes. Do you have any food you could send my way?</string>
        <string _locid="39302">My lumberjacks have gone on strike. Would you give me wood?</string>
        <string _locid="39303">If you could spare some wood I would be a very happy ally.</string>
        <string _locid="39304">Your reinforcements surely turned the tide of battle, many thanks. Now we can continue forward.</string>
        <string _locid="39305">Your troops have saved the day. Our offensive movement presses on.</string>
        <string _locid="39306">An offensive victory all thanks to your soldiers.</string>
        <string _locid="39307">Thanks for the coin. I'm off to the tavern now.</string>
        <string _locid="39308">The children shall eat, thanks to your generosity.</string>
        <string _locid="39309">My base still stands because of your help. I will erect a statue here in your honor.</string>
        <string _locid="39310">Thank you for helping fend off the invaders.</string>
        <string _locid="39311">Many thanks are in order for your reinforcements at my base.</string>
        <string _locid="39312">Your tribute is greatly appreciated.</string>
        <string _locid="39313">Ah, so much wood to build new buildings with! Thank you my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="39314">We are crumbling under the might of the British empire.</string>
        <string _locid="39315">The Dutch will be our undoing.</string>
        <string _locid="39316">It seems the French forces will overtake us soon.</string>
        <string _locid="39319">I fear we shall fall to the rebel Portuguese forces.</string>
        <string _locid="39320">It looks as if our towns will be waving  Russian flags soon.</string>
        <string _locid="39321">The Spanish conquistadors have won the day.</string>
        <string _locid="39322">Perhaps if we attack the British we can turn this war around.</string>
        <string _locid="39323">Their alliance is proving to be stronger than expected, however my spies inform me the Dutch are the weakest. Let us strike them!</string>
        <string _locid="39324">We may have lost the war, but I believe we can still win a battle versus the French.</string>
        <string _locid="39325">Let us take down the Germans before our empire falls.</string>
        <string _locid="39326">The Germans can at least be taken out of this fight by immediate action on our part.</string>
        <string _locid="39327">It may prove impossible for us to defeat the enemy entirely, but I believe we can crush the rebel Portuguese forces.</string>
        <string _locid="39328">Our future is dim my friend, but not all is lost. Russia is vulnerable to attack.</string>
        <string _locid="39329">This war has not been favorable for us. Maybe if we hit the Spanish we can turn things around.</string>
        <string _locid="39330">It seems my long hours at the taverns have caused our defeat.</string>
        <string _locid="39331">Wish I could have been more helpful. My apologies.</string>
        <string _locid="39332">This is all your fault!</string>
        <string _locid="39333">Alas. This will always be remembered as the war you lost for us.</string>
        <string _locid="39334">The war seems to be going well. Keep up the good work.</string>
        <string _locid="39335">Good fortune smiles upon us. The war is in our favor.</string>
        <string _locid="39336">Your bravery has shone in battle, I am indebted to your strength.</string>
        <string _locid="39337">Because of you, we may indeed be victorious.</string>
        <string _locid="39338">Ha! We have the upper hand, despite your blunderings. Go make me a sandwich.</string>
        <string _locid="39339">While I'm off winning the campaign you're off looking at all the pretty graphics.</string>
        <string _locid="39340">Let us make the best of this and resign before we are utterly destroyed.</string>
        <string _locid="39341">Well, there is nothing left we can do to win. Let us resign and be done with it.</string>
        <string _locid="39342">Look on the bright side, they may die of the plague.</string>
        <string _locid="39343">The enemy has reached a monopoly. Let us make plans to destroy it as soon as possible.</string>
        <string _locid="39344">Figures. The enemy is recruiting the locals to help them.</string>
        <string _locid="39345">It looks as if the enemy is trying to get a leg up on us economically.</string>
        <string _locid="39346">The enemy has more native sites than us now. Argh.</string>
        <string _locid="39347">Be warned, the enemy is trying to outdo us economically. Look, they have more trade sites than us now.</string>
        <string _locid="39349">Hooray! We have the first trade site.</string>
        <string _locid="39350">Well done. I can see I have made a wise alliance.</string>
        <string _locid="39351">Quite the skills you got there.</string>
        <string _locid="39352">The first treasure, surely an omen of good fortune.</string>
        <string _locid="39353">Excellent. You truly are the master of getting booty.</string>
        <string _locid="39354">Good work on collecting treasures, my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="39355">Nothing like a full treasure chest, eh?</string>
        <string _locid="39356">You shall eat well tonight, my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="39357">Your plundering skills are amazing. Do you happen to have a treasure map by chance?</string>
        <string _locid="39358">You should at least say thank you for that one.</string>
        <string _locid="39359">Natives to the rescue!</string>
        <string _locid="39360">Good work, a gainful boon to your economy.</string>
        <string _locid="39361">A bundle of extra wood should definitely come in handy.</string>
        <string _locid="39362">Thanks to you we now hold more native sites.</string>
        <string _locid="39363">Good work. We now control more trade sites than they do.</string>
        <string _locid="39364">Perhaps those resources would be better spent on troops?</string>
        <string _locid="39365">Playing defensive are we? Well then I expect you to come wall around my base too.</string>
        <string _locid="39366">I have struck a deal with the natives. They now fight for us.</string>
        <string _locid="39367">I am now the proud owner of the first trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="39368">Behold! What wondrous treasures this New World contains.</string>
        <string _locid="39369">More treasure for us now, and less treasure for our enemies to pick up later.</string>
        <string _locid="39370">Marvelous, what a find!</string>
        <string _locid="39371">There is nothing like the sound of coins filling my coffers.</string>
        <string _locid="39372">My my, a feast for kings I just discovered.</string>
        <string _locid="39373">I found this treasure lying around your base. Don't worry though, I will repay the favor soon enough.</string>
        <string _locid="39374">I love exploring and discovering treasure, but it is important you do so as well.</string>
        <string _locid="39375">I hope you're not expecting me to collect all the treasure.</string>
        <string _locid="39376">Great! We now have native warriors among our ranks.</string>
        <string _locid="39377">The more settlers I rescue, the more resources I'll have to contribute to our effort.</string>
        <string _locid="39378">I found some wood to boost the construction of future buildings.</string>
        <string _locid="39379">I have convinced more natives to help us in our cause.</string>
        <string _locid="39380">I have constructed another trade site for us. This will directly contribute to our resource funds.</string>
        <string _locid="39381">By building walls around my base I hope to keep the enemy out. Your forces, of course, are welcome inside.</string>
        <string _locid="39382">These sturdy walls should serve as an excellent fallback point in the event we need it.</string>
        <string _locid="39383">Our efforts have paid off, we now control a monopoly. Now let us defend it!</string>
        <string _locid="39384">Welcome back to the battlefield, sir. I trust your time away was productive.</string>
        <string _locid="39385">Nice to see you again. I can tell your skills as a leader have grown.</string>
        <string _locid="39386">Great to have you back. I have heard tales of your conquests around the globe.</string>
        <string _locid="39387">Unfortunately their monopoly will be our downfall.</string>
        <string _locid="39388">Congratulations. Our monopoly has surely been the cause of our triumph.</string>
        <string _locid="39389">This shall be a battle for the history books ... and I shall be recorded as the victor.</string>
        <string _locid="39390">Shall I go ahead and declare myself the victor now or are you actually going to fight?</string>
        <string _locid="39391">You realize you stand no chance of winning?</string>
        <string _locid="39392">Any last requests before I rip your army asunder?</string>
        <string _locid="39393">I bet you wish your allies were as helpful as mine.</string>
        <string _locid="39394">I had you if not for your ally's support ... I had you!</string>
        <string _locid="39395">Your speed is impressive, but your strength may be lacking.</string>
        <string _locid="39396">Fancy technology will mean little when my army plunders your town.</string>
        <string _locid="39397">Trying to oppress the locals will not win you the war.</string>
        <string _locid="39398">Destroying the local culture is reprehensible, why don't you strike at me instead?</string>
        <string _locid="39399">You have razed my town center, you filthy swine!</string>
        <string _locid="39400">Cutting off my trade routes will not save you from the wrath of my army.</string>
        <string _locid="39401">Technological advancements are marvelous things. You should try them sometime.</string>
        <string _locid="39402">I feel so sorry for your poor technological advancements I'm almost tempted to send you some resources. Heh, almost.</string>
        <string _locid="39403">I will tell them to put 'First to reach Colonial Age' on your tombstone.</string>
        <string _locid="39404">How is it the saying goes? Last to Colonial Age, first to die?</string>
        <string _locid="39405">Your town is so far from your allies. They won't be able to hear your screams as your town is being burned to cinders.</string>
        <string _locid="39406">Cowards of a feather flock together. I suppose that's why you and your ally built next to each other.</string>
        <string _locid="39407">Nice try. Try again.</string>
        <string _locid="39408">Ha ha. I have freed the natives from your oppression.</string>
        <string _locid="39409">I shall keep the rubble from your town as a souvenir of my conquests.</string>
        <string _locid="39410">I have destroyed your trading post. What are you going to do?</string>
        <string _locid="39411">It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Of course it will be even more of a pleasure to destroy you.</string>
        <string _locid="39412">How is it again they say "Prepare to die" in your native tongue?</string>
        <string _locid="39413">Always a pleasure to meet new opponents to conquer.</string>
        <string _locid="39414">It's always nice to challenge ourselves isn't it?</string>
        <string _locid="39415">Perhaps you can defeat me if I don't try as hard.</string>
        <string _locid="39416">This all seems so familiar to me.</string>
        <string _locid="39417">Perhaps you stand a greater chance of winning now that you have strategically reduced your enemies.</string>
        <string _locid="39418">You are arrogant to assume you can conquer me with my new alliances.</string>
        <string _locid="39419">Behold. My explorer walks again.</string>
        <string _locid="39420">You should not be so obvious. I have discovered your explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="39421">Your explorer isn't the stealthiest character is he?</string>
        <string _locid="39422">If your army is in need of guidance you can gladly send them to fight for me.</string>
        <string _locid="39423">Are you going to attack me or were you just out for a stroll?</string>
        <string _locid="39424">Sending your soldiers into the jaws of the beast ... you are either very brave or very very foolish.</string>
        <string _locid="39425">Did I give you permission to kill my villagers? Prepare to die.</string>
        <string _locid="39426">Killing my defenseless settlers I see ... do not think I'll have mercy on your women and children now!</string>
        <string _locid="39427">Your army is huge. I'm afraid of the number of graves I'll have to dig for them.</string>
        <string _locid="39428">Your ragtag band of brigands do not scare me!</string>
        <string _locid="39429">All right. We'll call it a draw.</string>
        <string _locid="39430">You call that an army?</string>
        <string _locid="39431">I see your town. It will look beautiful once my banner is flying over it.</string>
        <string _locid="39432">Aha! I have found your town center. You might as well resign now.</string>
        <string _locid="39433">It was a pleasure doing business with you.</string>
        <string _locid="39434">Let the onslaught begin!</string>
        <string _locid="39435">Have no mercy and offer no quarter! Attack! Attack! </string>
        <string _locid="39436">Charge! Cut them down and let them drown in their own blood! Charge!</string>
        <string _locid="39437">I have not seen any activity from you in a while. Clearly you have taken up gardening.</string>
        <string _locid="39438">Why don't you use this downtime to go fetch me some wine.</string>
        <string _locid="39439">Ho hum. You are turning out to be quite the boring adversary.</string>
        <string _locid="39441">Clearly I underestimated you. So I must resign.</string>
        <string _locid="39442">Somehow you outwitted me. Now I am forced to surrender.</string>
        <string _locid="39443">Good. I was hoping you would offer a challenge at some point.</string>
        <string _locid="39444">Capitalizing on what I started, I see.</string>
        <string _locid="39445">While you are busy constructing more trade sites, I make plans for your demise.</string>
        <string _locid="39446">Congratulations you have found the first treasure! You can resign now.</string>
        <string _locid="39447">You were the first to find some treasure, and you will be the first to die. Coincidence? I think not.</string>
        <string _locid="39448">Hand that over, by order of the Portuguese royal empire.</string>
        <string _locid="39449">Enjoy your plunder while you can.</string>
        <string _locid="39450">Just imagine, they'll print my face on your coins soon enough.</string>
        <string _locid="39451">Glad to see you have found some food. You were looking awfully frail.</string>
        <string _locid="39452">You have captured much treasure so far. Hmm, well I guess we all have our talents.</string>
        <string _locid="39453">You took my treasure you rabid dog you.</string>
        <string _locid="39454">Why must you bring more innocents to die for your cause?</string>
        <string _locid="39455">I suppose you'll need some way of replacing the ones I kill.</string>
        <string _locid="39456">I suggest you build a ship with that and sail far far away.</string>
        <string _locid="39457">Building walls I see. I'd be afraid of me too.</string>
        <string _locid="39458">Walls will not stop the might of my army. They will rip them down like saplings trampled by a stampede of bulls.</string>
        <string _locid="39459">No doubt you are trembling in fear to know I have recruited the locals to join my cause.</string>
        <string _locid="39460">All the more for me.</string>
        <string _locid="39461">Oh ho, look what I have found!</string>
        <string _locid="39462">One more treasure closer to victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39463">Ohh, shiny.</string>
        <string _locid="39464">Now my settlers will grow strong with this bounty.</string>
        <string _locid="39465">While you were off picking flowers I discovered this treasure just outside of your base.</string>
        <string _locid="39466">In case you forgot, collecting treasure is a good thing.</string>
        <string _locid="39467">It's always nice to know the natives are supportive of my efforts.</string>
        <string _locid="39468">Imagine how much more productive my economy will be now.</string>
        <string _locid="39469">I have discovered some lumber just now. What have you done lately?</string>
        <string _locid="39470">Resorting to hiring the natives I see. Typical.</string>
        <string _locid="39471">Do not think that that trade site alone will win you the game.</string>
        <string _locid="39472">Four of a kind might be a sure win in poker, but not in this game.</string>
        <string _locid="39473">Well, one way or another we shall be victorious. Your doom is on the horizon.</string>
        <string _locid="39474">Been letting your kid sister play lately?</string>
        <string _locid="39475">Sooo ... which cheat codes have you been using?</string>
        <string _locid="39476">Many games. Many follies I assume.</string>
        <string _locid="39477">We must take out their trading posts now!</string>
        <string _locid="39478">Where is your army? We must stop the counter!</string>
        <string _locid="39479">Stand firm, pet. Victory is nearly ours.</string>
        <string _locid="39480">Keep our trading posts alive and we shall have our victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39481">Where is your artillery, pet? </string>
        <string _locid="39482">Some artillery would teach these dogs a very dear lesson indeed.</string>
        <string _locid="39483">You would do better if you had some cavalry backing up that army.</string>
        <string _locid="39484">I see men, but no horses. Do you think that wise?</string>
        <string _locid="39485">Your ranks are thin. Some infantry would be a wise investment.</string>
        <string _locid="39486">A balanced army requires infantry. You should add some quickly.</string>
        <string _locid="39487">That battle is folly. Rally your men elsewhere.</string>
        <string _locid="39488">You are outgunned, pet. Pull back to safety.</string>
        <string _locid="39489">Madness! You send your men to death!</string>
        <string _locid="39490">Only your enemy and scavengers will benefit from that fight. I suggest a fast retreat.</string>
        <string _locid="39491">Such reckless fighting will only lead to defeat. Save your men for another battle.</string>
        <string _locid="39492">Such a display of strength! </string>
        <string _locid="39493">The battlefield grows crowded. </string>
        <string _locid="39494">Your inexperience as a commander is obvious.</string>
        <string _locid="39495">Whoever put you in charge should have his head examined. </string>
        <string _locid="39496">You won't last long if that is the best you have to offer.</string>
        <string _locid="39497">Your attempts at combat are amusing, but it is the Spanish who are victorious.</string>
        <string _locid="39498">I have underestimated you. I will be more careful in the future.</string>
        <string _locid="39499">Such skill. It is enough to make a girl cry.</string>
        <string _locid="39500">Your troops are strong. I will not make that mistake again.</string>
        <string _locid="39501">How could this have happened? You will pay for this outrage.</string>
        <string _locid="39502">It would seem my troops will need more encouragement after this turn of events.</string>
        <string _locid="39503">I don't want to gloat, but this was too easy.</string>
        <string _locid="39504">See how the dogs fall before my armies?</string>
        <string _locid="39505">At this rate, victory will soon be ours.</string>
        <string _locid="39506">I shall never grow tired of such easy victories.</string>
        <string _locid="39507">All of our foes will soon wear the mark of my boot heel like these now do.</string>
        <string _locid="39508">See how the cowards fall before my soldiers?</string>
        <string _locid="39509">Even my weakest armies can defeat our foes. </string>
        <string _locid="39510">Who would have thought our enemies would roll over and die so willingly.</string>
        <string _locid="39511">Do you see the strength of the Spanish? We are unstoppable.</string>
        <string _locid="39512">Their armies are no match for even my weakest men.</string>
        <string _locid="39513">Don't worry about me, I can easily defeat these dogs.</string>
        <string _locid="39514">Fear not, pet. I have this battle under control.</string>
        <string _locid="39515">Don't trouble your head about this rabble. I will take care of it.</string>
        <string _locid="39516">Since I'm doing all the fighting here, maybe you can engage the enemy somewhere else.</string>
        <string _locid="39517">This battle won't last long, since I have the advantage.</string>
        <string _locid="39518">Your help is not needed here. I will crush the barbarians in moments.</string>
        <string _locid="39519">Your timing is perfect. Onward to victory!</string>
        <string _locid="39520">Thanks for your help, pet. Now let's crush these dogs!</string>
        <string _locid="39521">The enemies multiply before my very eyes. How could this have happened?</string>
        <string _locid="39522">Where did this second foe come from? They will turn the tide of battle.</string>
        <string _locid="39523">Of course, pet.</string>
        <string _locid="39524">Don't think twice about it.</string>
        <string _locid="39525">So demanding. But, all right.</string>
        <string _locid="39526">I concur.</string>
        <string _locid="39527">All right, but you owe me.</string>
        <string _locid="39528">Yes. Artillery will surely ruin their day.</string>
        <string _locid="39529">My subjects will start on that artillery right away.</string>
        <string _locid="39530">Of course, artillery! You are so clever.</string>
        <string _locid="39531">Yes. Some artillery surrounded by cavalry would be splendid.</string>
        <string _locid="39532">You are so smart, pet. I will start right away on the artillery and infantry.</string>
        <string _locid="39533">Some big, strong horsemen will certainly impress the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="39534">Mighty cavalry from Spain will crush the enemy forces.</string>
        <string _locid="39535">Such powerful beasts manned by fine, Spanish soldiers will soon take the field.</string>
        <string _locid="39536">I have heard your request and concur. I will build cavalry and artillery.</string>
        <string _locid="39537">I am in a good mood. I will build the cavalry and infantry you have asked for.</string>
        <string _locid="39538">I have sent for the finest warriors Spain has to offer. They shall join us soon.</string>
        <string _locid="39539">Yes, I need more men.</string>
        <string _locid="39540">A larger force of men is just what I need.</string>
        <string _locid="39541">Oh, fine. Infantry and artillery are on their way.</string>
        <string _locid="39542">You are a brazen thing. But your request for infantry and cavalry is fair.</string>
        <string _locid="39543">I would love to, pet. But I have many things that need my attention.</string>
        <string _locid="39544">The resources of Spain are not infinite. Be patient.</string>
        <string _locid="39545">You are so demanding. But your request must wait.</string>
        <string _locid="39546">No one may command my men but me.</string>
        <string _locid="39547">Watch yourself, pet. Only I may speak to my generals so.</string>
        <string _locid="39548">Impossible. You ask too much of me. </string>
        <string _locid="39549">It pains me to tell you that I do not have the manpower for that.</string>
        <string _locid="39550">Be patient. I do not have the troops to do that.</string>
        <string _locid="39551">I would help you if I had the troops, but I have none.</string>
        <string _locid="39552">You ask too much. </string>
        <string _locid="39553">I cannot do such a thing.</string>
        <string _locid="39554">Leave me. You ask the impossible.</string>
        <string _locid="39555">I do not have the manpower to help you right now.</string>
        <string _locid="39556">If I had more troops, I would gladly help you.</string>
        <string _locid="39557">Your moves are bold, but I have not the army to help.</string>
        <string _locid="39558">They have broken our hold. We should look closer at our strategy.</string>
        <string _locid="39559">The trading post is destroyed. How dare they do that to me.</string>
        <string _locid="39560">It would appear the island dwellers are almost defeated.</string>
        <string _locid="39561">The Dutch are close to defeat.</string>
        <string _locid="39562">Keep up the pressure, pet. The Dutch will soon fall.</string>
        <string _locid="39563">The French have almost fallen to our combined might.</string>
        <string _locid="39564">The Germans are no match for us. </string>
        <string _locid="39565">Do not stop. The Ottomans are in retreat.</string>
        <string _locid="39566">The cowards! Kneel before Isabella!</string>
        <string _locid="39567">Stay on them. The Russian dogs will lick my boot heels yet.</string>
        <string _locid="39568">There is room in Spain for only one crown. Destroy the Spanish traitors.</string>
        <string _locid="39569">Hiding across the channel has made the British strong.</string>
        <string _locid="39570">The Dutch are strong. We must be cautious.</string>
        <string _locid="39571">Where have the French gained such strength?</string>
        <string _locid="39572">Beware the Germans. They seem particularly strong.</string>
        <string _locid="39573">Could the Ottomans really be this strong?</string>
        <string _locid="39574">The Portuguese have made great strides. Their army is powerful.</string>
        <string _locid="39575">The Russians are a stubborn lot. We will have to redouble our efforts against them.</string>
        <string _locid="39576">It is no surprise that the Spanish are strong. We must be careful.</string>
        <string _locid="39577">You are so strong, pet. But be careful where you spend your resources. </string>
        <string _locid="39578">You have advanced so quickly. I hope it was not too fast.</string>
        <string _locid="39579">Is it really so important for you to be above me?</string>
        <string _locid="39580">The enemy allies with natives. We should be careful.</string>
        <string _locid="39581">They have found native help. Keep an eye out for attacks.</string>
        <string _locid="39582">Our foes consort with the natives. Be wary of attacks.</string>
        <string _locid="39583">You lag behind, pet. Have you forgotten to go Colonial?</string>
        <string _locid="39584">I hope your strategy includes aging up to Colonial soon.</string>
        <string _locid="39585">If you don't at least go Colonial soon, our enemies will have the advantage.</string>
        <string _locid="39586">Why do you lag behind? </string>
        <string _locid="39587">It is nice to have you behind me, but our foes will win if you stay there.</string>
        <string _locid="39588">Why are you so slow to Age up? Our enemies will have an advantage if you don't advance.</string>
        <string _locid="39589">So fast! But leave some resources for other things.</string>
        <string _locid="39590">You are quick, pet. But will you be able to support your colony?</string>
        <string _locid="39591">Finally! I was beginning to think you would never join the rest of us.</string>
        <string _locid="39592">If you are so slow at everything, we will never triumph.</string>
        <string _locid="39593">Such a bold rescue! You have my nation's gratitude.</string>
        <string _locid="39594">Saved at last! You are so brave and so helpful.</string>
        <string _locid="39595">Ah, my explorer lives. Your kindness is unequaled.</string>
        <string _locid="39596">I will not tolerate such sneaky maneuvers.</string>
        <string _locid="39597">Such underhanded methods will not go unpunished.</string>
        <string _locid="39598">Such obvious tactics only make me sad.</string>
        <string _locid="39599">The natives are free of our enemy's subversion.</string>
        <string _locid="39600">I have removed the yoke of our foes from these people.</string>
        <string _locid="39601">I have removed our enemy's corruption from these native peoples.</string>
        <string _locid="39602">The enemy town lies in ashes beneath my boots.</string>
        <string _locid="39603">How glorious to see the ruins of our enemy's buildings.</string>
        <string _locid="39604">All our enemies will fall as this town did.</string>
        <string _locid="39605">The enemy will not exploit this trade route anymore.</string>
        <string _locid="39606">This trading post fell easily. Why wasn't it more heavily guarded?</string>
        <string _locid="39607">And that, pet, is how you destroy a trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="39608">The natives here are strong. I must be more careful.</string>
        <string _locid="39609">Where were you? I could have used your help.</string>
        <string _locid="39610">This town was well defended. We need to bring more troops next time.</string>
        <string _locid="39611">I could have used some more help attacking this town.</string>
        <string _locid="39612">The trade site still stands. We need to focus more power there.</string>
        <string _locid="39613">This post was too well guarded. I have better things to do anyway.</string>
        <string _locid="39614">My explorer is too hasty. He will get a spanking when he returns.</string>
        <string _locid="39615">Why does he run into trouble like that? I will not be able to gather treasures until he revives.</string>
        <string _locid="39616">My explorer is down. Be a dear and go find him.</string>
        <string _locid="39617">The dangers of the New World are many, as my explorer has found out.</string>
        <string _locid="39618">My explorer has succumbed to the environment.</string>
        <string _locid="39619">The wilds have claimed another son of Spain.</string>
        <string _locid="39620">The enemy is too strong. We should bow out gracefully.</string>
        <string _locid="39621">I cannot keep throwing resources at this folly. I am ready to resign.</string>
        <string _locid="39622">You fought bravely, pet. But we are done.</string>
        <string _locid="39623">I grow weary of events in the New World. We should stop.</string>
        <string _locid="39624">I knew coming here was a bad idea. I want to recall my people.</string>
        <string _locid="39625">Your strength is needed here. </string>
        <string _locid="39626">Send troops here, pet.</string>
        <string _locid="39627">I have run into the enemy. Send an army here.</string>
        <string _locid="39628">I cannot handle so many men. Send help now.</string>
        <string _locid="39629">The enemy has swarmed into my town. I need help.</string>
        <string _locid="39630">Send help, pet. I don't have the army to repel this attack.</string>
        <string _locid="39631">I hope you are stronger than my last ally.</string>
        <string _locid="39632">Greetings, pet. It is a pleasure to have you at my side.</string>
        <string _locid="39633">Together, we will soon have the enemy begging for mercy.</string>
        <string _locid="39634">You are brave to try again at a higher difficulty.</string>
        <string _locid="39635">I hope your brazen jump in difficulty does not end in disappointment.</string>
        <string _locid="39636">Are you sure this jump in difficulty was not a mistake?</string>
        <string _locid="39637">I see you are taking it a little easier this time. That is probably best.</string>
        <string _locid="39638">Did the higher difficulty not agree with you?</string>
        <string _locid="39639">It is probably best for you to stay here a while before you try to move up again.</string>
        <string _locid="39640">It will be nice not to be on the receiving end of your assault this time.</string>
        <string _locid="39641">Your score was most impressive last time. I will do my best to keep up.</string>
        <string _locid="39642">Did you like the taste of my boot? I will try not to be so rough this time.</string>
        <string _locid="39643">You need to keep up, pet. Try to get your score up higher this time.</string>
        <string _locid="39644">Do you remember the time we spent here together the last time? </string>
        <string _locid="39645">You need to do better this game if you want to keep from making me cry.</string>
        <string _locid="39646">Your performance last time was less than impressive. Do better this time.</string>
        <string _locid="39647">You had an impressive game last time. I am looking forward to a repeat performance.</string>
        <string _locid="39648">I am glad you are here with me again.</string>
        <string _locid="39649">Since you are incapable of rescuing my explorer, I have sent his ransom.</string>
        <string _locid="39650">Curse my explorer's brashness. He has cost me dear today.</string>
        <string _locid="39651">My explorer is back, but it cost me dearly.</string>
        <string _locid="39652">I have rescued my explorer. Our foes can choke on their ransom demands.</string>
        <string _locid="39653">My explorer is back, now that I have rescued him.</string>
        <string _locid="39654">Since you have waited so long, I have rescued my explorer myself.</string>
        <string _locid="39655">I have grown tired waiting for you and have rescued my explorer myself.</string>
        <string _locid="39656">Where is their army? Is our foe so foolish as to leave his town undefended?</string>
        <string _locid="39657">Look, pet. Our enemy has left this tasty morsel undefended. </string>
        <string _locid="39658">This town is ripe for the picking, with no barracks to defend it.</string>
        <string _locid="39659">A town without a barracks is like an explorer without my jewels. It's not going to get very far.</string>
        <string _locid="39660">This town has no stable. Send in the artillery.</string>
        <string _locid="39661">This coin should help you with the cause.</string>
        <string _locid="39662">I hope this coin helps to sustain you.</string>
        <string _locid="39663">You need food to keep your stamina.</string>
        <string _locid="39664">Take this food to keep your men strong.</string>
        <string _locid="39665">Spanish wood built the armada. Use this to power our victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39666">This wood will keep your forces strong.</string>
        <string _locid="39667">There is no substitute for Spanish wood!</string>
        <string _locid="39668">Our foes will soon taste Spanish steel.</string>
        <string _locid="39669">My forces are moving forward to attack our enemy's base.</string>
        <string _locid="39670">This base will feel the stamp of my boot heel.</string>
        <string _locid="39671">These gatherers will rue the day their country took on the Spanish.</string>
        <string _locid="39672">The fools have left these people to die at my hand.</string>
        <string _locid="39673">No quarter shall be given to any enemy of the Spanish.</string>
        <string _locid="39674">My forces are moving to take the main enemy town.</string>
        <string _locid="39675">The sons of Spain will soon be masters of this town.</string>
        <string _locid="39676">Come bask in my glory as we dismantle this town.</string>
        <string _locid="39677">These natives will soon be free of their captors.</string>
        <string _locid="39678">It is time to let these people know how they are being deceived.</string>
        <string _locid="39679">Let us remove the blindfold put on these natives by our enemies.</string>
        <string _locid="39680">Our enemies get too much from this trade site.</string>
        <string _locid="39681">This trade site has profited our foes for too long.</string>
        <string _locid="39682">Stand firm, pet. The sons of Spain are on their way to join you.</string>
        <string _locid="39683">You are so bold to attack there. I will send you help.</string>
        <string _locid="39684">Brilliant! I will join you soon.</string>
        <string _locid="39685">I need more men. A base will be perfect here.</string>
        <string _locid="39686">Careful, pet. I am putting a military base here.</string>
        <string _locid="39687">I will put a base here. Would you care to join me?</string>
        <string _locid="39688">As Spain prospers, I will need more room. </string>
        <string _locid="39689">This is a perfect spot for a town center.</string>
        <string _locid="39690">The riches of Spain will allow me to put another town center here.</string>
        <string _locid="39691">I will build another town center here to the glory of Spain.</string>
        <string _locid="39692">I am going to seek help from these native peoples.</string>
        <string _locid="39693">These natives will make a powerful ally.</string>
        <string _locid="39694">With the help of these people, we will be unstoppable.</string>
        <string _locid="39695">I will ask these people for help in defeating our common foe.</string>
        <string _locid="39696">This trade site will help to fuel our victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39697">Watch my back while I build a trade site here.</string>
        <string _locid="39698">The dogs will not get their teeth into this building.</string>
        <string _locid="39699">I will defend this building, pet.</string>
        <string _locid="39700">My forces will hold this spot to their dying breath.</string>
        <string _locid="39701">The enemy will not get past me here.</string>
        <string _locid="39702">This village is mine. I won't let them take it away.</string>
        <string _locid="39703">These people need my help. I will defend them.</string>
        <string _locid="39704">The enemy draws near. I will need to defend this town.</string>
        <string _locid="39705">The dogs will not take this town from the Spanish.</string>
        <string _locid="39706">I will be defending this trade site, pet.</string>
        <string _locid="39707">I will defend here at this trade site.</string>
        <string _locid="39708">Watch your coffers. I will keep sending coin.</string>
        <string _locid="39709">Did you enjoy that? I will send more soon.</string>
        <string _locid="39710">More food will be arriving when I am able to send it.</string>
        <string _locid="39711">Fear not, pet. More food is on the way.</string>
        <string _locid="39712">There is more wood where that came from.</string>
        <string _locid="39713">Did that wood make you smile? You will get another surprise soon.</string>
        <string _locid="39714">Stand fast. Help is on the way.</string>
        <string _locid="39715">My men are on the way to your location.</string>
        <string _locid="39716">The dogs will pay for attacking you here when my troops arrive.</string>
        <string _locid="39717">Tell me you love me.</string>
        <string _locid="39718">Such quiet. Are you mad at me?</string>
        <string _locid="39719">Playing the strong, silent type?</string>
        <string _locid="39720">Be a dear and send me some coin.</string>
        <string _locid="39721">Some coin would really help our cause right now.</string>
        <string _locid="39722">Send me some coin and I will make it worth your while.</string>
        <string _locid="39723">Some food would be appreciated.</string>
        <string _locid="39724">Do you have any food to feed the sons of Spain?</string>
        <string _locid="39725">The Spanish empire needs food to fight the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="39726">I could really use some wood.</string>
        <string _locid="39727">Do you have some wood for me?</string>
        <string _locid="39728">I seem to really be burning through the wood. Can you give me some?</string>
        <string _locid="39729">Your help is appreciated. Now lets move our forces forward.</string>
        <string _locid="39730">That went so much better after you joined in.</string>
        <string _locid="39731">Our combined offensive force cannot be stopped.</string>
        <string _locid="39732">Your gift of coin is most appreciated.</string>
        <string _locid="39733">You are so good to me.</string>
        <string _locid="39734">This food will go far.</string>
        <string _locid="39735">The Spanish people thank you for your generosity.</string>
        <string _locid="39736">Your help was most generous.</string>
        <string _locid="39737">I must think of some way to thank you.</string>
        <string _locid="39738">Your men arrived in the nick of time.</string>
        <string _locid="39739">I am overflowing. You are too generous.</string>
        <string _locid="39740">Are you trying to impress me with your mighty economy?</string>
        <string _locid="39741">Your gift of wood was generous.</string>
        <string _locid="39742">So much wood! You are too kind.</string>
        <string _locid="39743">These island dwellers are powerful. We are in trouble.</string>
        <string _locid="39744">Curse the British! They are a powerful foe.</string>
        <string _locid="39745">The Dutch are so powerful. Is there nothing we can do to stop them?</string>
        <string _locid="39746">The cursed French are winning this day.</string>
        <string _locid="39747">These Ottomans are worthy foes. I have underestimated them.</string>
        <string _locid="39748">The Portuguese dogs! Where did they learn to fight so well?</string>
        <string _locid="39749">The Russians are overpowering us with numbers.</string>
        <string _locid="39750">It is no surprise the Spanish are strong, but they should be fighting for me.</string>
        <string _locid="39751">How can these weak British be doing so well?</string>
        <string _locid="39752">Despite the weakness of the Dutch, we are losing.</string>
        <string _locid="39753">How can this be? The French dogs are weak, but we are still losing.</string>
        <string _locid="39754">Despite Germany's weakness, we are being routed. </string>
        <string _locid="39755">How do we expect to win when we can't even handle a weak Portuguese force?</string>
        <string _locid="39756">The Russians fall before our forces, but we still can't push the advantage.</string>
        <string _locid="39757">This renegade group of Spanish is no match for the crown, but I fear we have lost.</string>
        <string _locid="39758">I have let you down. </string>
        <string _locid="39759">You are so strong, but my forces are falling too quickly.</string>
        <string _locid="39760">I had hoped you would be strong for me. </string>
        <string _locid="39761">You disappoint me, and we will both suffer for it.</string>
        <string _locid="39762">The enemy is in disarray. We make a good team.</string>
        <string _locid="39763">We should press our advantage while we are ahead.</string>
        <string _locid="39764">You are so strong! </string>
        <string _locid="39765">It would seem I have chosen a strong ally.</string>
        <string _locid="39766">You will need to do better if you want to keep up with me.</string>
        <string _locid="39767">War is not for the weak. You must work harder to keep favor with the Spanish.</string>
        <string _locid="39768">We are done. Spain has nothing left for this game.</string>
        <string _locid="39769">I am spent. We have lost the day.</string>
        <string _locid="39770">Did you not hear me? We are defeated.</string>
        <string _locid="39771">Your intent to fight on is noble, but it will get you naught. </string>
        <string _locid="39772">Your insistence on continuing this fight is folly. I will not add to your body count.</string>
        <string _locid="39773">You waste resources on this lost cause. When will you see the truth?</string>
        <string _locid="39774">Those rascals have gathered 4 trading posts. We must act quickly.</string>
        <string _locid="39775">We must hurry or they will attain a four of a kind victory.</string>
        <string _locid="39776">Our enemies extend their influence over the natives.</string>
        <string _locid="39777">The natives have fallen victim to our enemies' influence.</string>
        <string _locid="39778">Our foes have set up a trade site.</string>
        <string _locid="39779">The enemy has a trade site. We should be careful they do not get more.</string>
        <string _locid="39780">The enemy continues to gather natives. Are we going to let them get away with that?</string>
        <string _locid="39781">They continue to dominate the local natives. We should do something to lift their oppression.</string>
        <string _locid="39782">They have another trade site. We should crush them.</string>
        <string _locid="39783">They continue to pursue trade sites. Be careful they don't get any more.</string>
        <string _locid="39784">You are so smart to keep the enemy from oppressing these people.</string>
        <string _locid="39785">Good thinking! We can use the help of the natives.</string>
        <string _locid="39786">Nice work! That trade site will come in handy.</string>
        <string _locid="39787">Brilliant! You are smart to get a trade site before anyone else.</string>
        <string _locid="39788">So fast! You are a quick one.</string>
        <string _locid="39789">You don't wait for anything, do you?</string>
        <string _locid="39790">Nothing stands in your way, does it?</string>
        <string _locid="39791">Your explorer is quite bold.</string>
        <string _locid="39792">That coin will certainly come in handy.</string>
        <string _locid="39793">A girl could really get behind an ally with so much coin.</string>
        <string _locid="39794">That will satisfy many appetites.</string>
        <string _locid="39795">Just seeing that food makes me ravenous.</string>
        <string _locid="39796">Do you do everything so quickly?</string>
        <string _locid="39797">Your proficiency is impressive.</string>
        <string _locid="39798">You are very forward to be nosing around here.</string>
        <string _locid="39799">What, don't you get enough over in your own area?</string>
        <string _locid="39800">I will thank you to keep your hands off my treasures.</string>
        <string _locid="39801">You can use that native to scout.</string>
        <string _locid="39802">Ask that native to scout the surrounding wilderness.</string>
        <string _locid="39803">Liberated settlers are hard workers.</string>
        <string _locid="39804">Free the people and they will gladly work for you.</string>
        <string _locid="39805">There is wood everywhere in this New World.</string>
        <string _locid="39806">You are lucky to find extra wood.</string>
        <string _locid="39807">Ah, we have more allies now.</string>
        <string _locid="39808">You are wise to gain more favor with the natives.</string>
        <string _locid="39809">Another trade site! You are bold, pet.</string>
        <string _locid="39810">We have the trade advantage now. </string>
        <string _locid="39811">I hope those walls will keep our foes out.</string>
        <string _locid="39812">Walls! A wise choice to make.</string>
        <string _locid="39813">I have been able to gain favor with the local natives.</string>
        <string _locid="39814">We have the native advantage now.</string>
        <string _locid="39815">This trade site was too good to pass up.</string>
        <string _locid="39816">How can we lose when I have gained the first trade site?</string>
        <string _locid="39817">There is no stopping me once I get started.</string>
        <string _locid="39818">See this treasure just waiting for me to find it?</string>
        <string _locid="39819">This treasure will look beautiful in the Prado.</string>
        <string _locid="39820">A girl could buy a lot with coin like this.</string>
        <string _locid="39821">If you are nice, some of this could be yours.</string>
        <string _locid="39822">Mmmm. Yummy food.</string>
        <string _locid="39823">This will go far to nourish the sons of Spain.</string>
        <string _locid="39824">You are so slow. I will take this one!</string>
        <string _locid="39825">Don't be mad at me, pet.</string>
        <string _locid="39826">Where is your explorer? Why is he not collecting treasures?</string>
        <string _locid="39827">Your explorer is lazy. He should be collecting treasures.</string>
        <string _locid="39828">Look at the men. This was a good treasure.</string>
        <string _locid="39829">See how the warriors flock to me? Are you jealous?</string>
        <string _locid="39830">The more people I find, the stronger my economy becomes.</string>
        <string _locid="39831">These poor souls will gladly work for a kind savior like me.</string>
        <string _locid="39832">Look at the wood!</string>
        <string _locid="39833">This wood will go far to build my colony.</string>
        <string _locid="39834">I have put us ahead in natives.</string>
        <string _locid="39835">We have gained the advantage in natives again.</string>
        <string _locid="39836">My trade site has put us ahead.</string>
        <string _locid="39837">We may have been tied for some time, but now we are ahead again.</string>
        <string _locid="39838">These walls will not keep you out, pet.</string>
        <string _locid="39839">The enemy will find a surprise when he runs into these walls.</string>
        <string _locid="39840">We need to hold on to these trading posts. Be ready for an immediate attack.</string>
        <string _locid="39841">The enemy will surely be looking to attack our trading posts now.</string>
        <string _locid="39842">What has happened, pet? You used to be much stronger.</string>
        <string _locid="39843">I see life in the colonies has not agreed with you.</string>
        <string _locid="39844">You have grown so strong since the last time we played.</string>
        <string _locid="39845">I like to think it was me that made you so powerful.</string>
        <string _locid="39846">You have been busy, pet. Where did you get all of that experience?</string>
        <string _locid="39847">You are certainly a lot more experienced than I remember.</string>
        <string _locid="39848">You are a beast, sneaking around and collecting trade posts this way.</string>
        <string _locid="39849">I cannot lose this way. You had better hope those trading posts are well defended.</string>
        <string _locid="39850">Hah! There is nothing you can do to stop us now.</string>
        <string _locid="39851">We are winning. You have nothing.</string>
        <string _locid="39852">I see you like it rough.</string>
        <string _locid="39853">Why is it I always seem to get double-teamed?</string>
        <string _locid="39854">Your soldiers' blood is on your hands.</string>
        <string _locid="39855">You send your men into certain death.</string>
        <string _locid="39857">See how we work as a team? You will face this all day.</string>
        <string _locid="39858">There is nothing I can't do with my ally behind me.</string>
        <string _locid="39859">You are lucky your ally has saved you. This time.</string>
        <string _locid="39860">So mean of you to gang up on poor me.</string>
        <string _locid="39861">You would be wiser to spend your resources on smarter things.</string>
        <string _locid="39862">Such free-spending is not going to impress me.</string>
        <string _locid="39863">You can not be so far ahead of me. You are spending most foolishly.</string>
        <string _locid="39864">The natives will not be fooled by your lies for long.</string>
        <string _locid="39865">Those natives will see you for what you are one day.</string>
        <string _locid="39866">You are lucky those men have chosen to ally with you.</string>
        <string _locid="39867">How dare you! These natives are my friends.</string>
        <string _locid="39868">You will regret that.</string>
        <string _locid="39869">Why are you picking on me?</string>
        <string _locid="39870">Leave my town alone!</string>
        <string _locid="39871">You weren't invited into my town. Go away.</string>
        <string _locid="39872">That trade site was mine!</string>
        <string _locid="39873">Why do you destroy my things?</string>
        <string _locid="39874">Eh. I will have that trade site back up in no time.</string>
        <string _locid="39875">Why do you languish in backwards times?</string>
        <string _locid="39876">You are so slow! You will never catch up to me now.</string>
        <string _locid="39877">I am so far ahead of you, you will never catch up!</string>
        <string _locid="39878">My forces are far superior to yours.</string>
        <string _locid="39879">Your advanced technology will make a splendid prize when my armies roll through your town.</string>
        <string _locid="39880">You may be first to Age up, but you will be last when the score is tallied.</string>
        <string _locid="39881">First to Age up is first to die.</string>
        <string _locid="39882">You had better get some troops out quickly, now that you have joined the rest of us in the modern world.</string>
        <string _locid="39883">Oh, you are alive. I was going to check for a pulse.</string>
        <string _locid="39884">Finally. I would be sad if my troops had no one to fight.</string>
        <string _locid="39885">Does your ally dislike you so much that he makes you build so far away from him?</string>
        <string _locid="39886">It must be very lonely for you to be so far away from your friends. I will send some men to keep you company.</string>
        <string _locid="39887">It was nice of you to save my troops from a long walk as they move from town to town.</string>
        <string _locid="39888">You will know my cannon are near when you hear them knocking down your ally's town.</string>
        <string _locid="39889">Are you really so scared that you need to stay so close to your ally?</string>
        <string _locid="39890">Hah! So much for your sneaky tactics.</string>
        <string _locid="39891">Did you not think I would be aware of your tactics?</string>
        <string _locid="39892">Those people are now free of your tyranny.</string>
        <string _locid="39893">You have no hold on these people now.</string>
        <string _locid="39894">That felt sooo good.</string>
        <string _locid="39895">I hope you felt that to your core.</string>
        <string _locid="39896">It will be a long time before you feel the gain from that trade site again.</string>
        <string _locid="39897">I hope that you didn't need that trade site too much.</string>
        <string _locid="39898">You seem to be a reasonable person, would you care to give up now?</string>
        <string _locid="39899">Surrender now and you will save yourself a lot of pain.</string>
        <string _locid="39901">Do you think it wise to attempt a more difficult setting this time? No matter. I will crush you regardless.</string>
        <string _locid="39902">I am disappointed that you are not the player I thought you were.</string>
        <string _locid="39903">It would seem that we were destined to meet here again.</string>
        <string _locid="39904">It won't matter how easy you try to make things on yourself. I will still see you beneath the heel of my boot.</string>
        <string _locid="39905">You are so brave to take on more enemies, but that will only increase your pain.</string>
        <string _locid="39906">Choke on your ransom, you dogs. </string>
        <string _locid="39907">I am sad that you must resort to kidnapping to finance your petty colony.</string>
        <string _locid="39908">Hello there, little man. Are you looking for treasure?</string>
        <string _locid="39909">Be careful out in the wilds, pet. There are many dangers waiting for you.</string>
        <string _locid="39910">This is the best army you can muster? And where are they going?</string>
        <string _locid="39911">It would appear your men have abandoned their leader and are looking to slink away like the dogs they are.</string>
        <string _locid="39913">I would love to get to know your men better, but I won't have time before they are annihilated.</string>
        <string _locid="39914">Oh look. Are these some deserters of yours, looking for a better life in Spain?</string>
        <string _locid="39915">I might have known I would find you attacking defenseless settlers.</string>
        <string _locid="39916">You can kill one or a hundred of us, but Spain will always triumph.</string>
        <string _locid="39917">You are no better than dogs, attacking unarmed civilians like that.</string>
        <string _locid="39918">These soldiers will make excellent target practice for my army.</string>
        <string _locid="39919">I had no idea hunting season had opened. Stay there, my army is on its way.</string>
        <string _locid="39920">I see your army is guarding that strategic field.</string>
        <string _locid="39921">You call that an army? No wonder they cower in the fields.</string>
        <string _locid="39922">Is that all you have? Come back when you are bigger.</string>
        <string _locid="39923">That so-called army is hardly worthy of the name.</string>
        <string _locid="39924">Well, isn't this an interesting turn of events.</string>
        <string _locid="39925">You may take my town, but you will never have my crown.</string>
        <string _locid="39926">Look at those lost lambs. I will give them a good home.</string>
        <string _locid="39927">What's this? More stragglers seeking comfort in the arms of Spain?</string>
        <string _locid="39929">There you are. It won't be long before Spanish flags wave from the windows.</string>
        <string _locid="39930">What a lovely spot. I think my cannon will go ... there.</string>
        <string _locid="39931">Hello. Don't get too comfortable in those buildings.</string>
        <string _locid="39932">You are so kind to let a lady go first.</string>
        <string _locid="39933">Your kindness will not go unpunished.</string>
        <string _locid="39934">Find your own treasures, dog.</string>
        <string _locid="39935">I hope you have saved some ammunition. You are going to need it.</string>
        <string _locid="39936">I hope that cake is ready, because here I come!</string>
        <string _locid="39937">Is that silence the sound of your corpse?</string>
        <string _locid="39938">I have heard more noise coming from a morgue.</string>
        <string _locid="39939">Let me know when you have finished your snack.</string>
        <string _locid="39940">It was nice of you to let me get some beauty sleep.</string>
        <string _locid="39941">You play too rough. I would like to stop now.</string>
        <string _locid="39942">Please let me leave here with some shred of dignity.</string>
        <string _locid="39943">I am done. You can stop now.</string>
        <string _locid="39944">You were lucky this time.</string>
        <string _locid="39945">Impressive, but you are only delaying the inevitable.</string>
        <string _locid="39946">An interesting strategy, but tricking the local natives will not help you.</string>
        <string _locid="39947">I see you like giving me lots of targets.</string>
        <string _locid="39948">Enjoy your spoils while you can, because that site will soon be in flames.</string>
        <string _locid="39949">So many wasted resources. You will be sad when I destroy that trade site.</string>
        <string _locid="39950">I hope you don't do everything so quickly.</string>
        <string _locid="39951">You are fast, but it takes more than speed to best me.</string>
        <string _locid="39952">This world holds many treasures for you, including the heel of my boot.</string>
        <string _locid="39953">Keep that treasure safe for me when I come to collect it from the smoking ashes of your town center.</string>
        <string _locid="39954">You should fight me instead of scurrying through the brush looking for trinkets.</string>
        <string _locid="39955">That coin will not buy you fame here in the New World.</string>
        <string _locid="39956">Strength is measured in power, not mere coin. You will need both to impress me.</string>
        <string _locid="39957">Enjoy that food now, you will soon be eating Spanish steel.</string>
        <string _locid="39958">That food will go well with the knives we have for your soldier's bellies.</string>
        <string _locid="39959">An impressive display of baubles, but you should pay more attention to your colony.</string>
        <string _locid="39960">Your explorer should be careful wandering so far from home.</string>
        <string _locid="39961">Who is this? Be careful out there little man.</string>
        <string _locid="39962">So far from home, it would be a shame if you met with some accident.</string>
        <string _locid="39963">Those natives can't help you if you are dead.</string>
        <string _locid="39964">It would be a shame if the natives learned of your true nature.</string>
        <string _locid="39965">Is there not a person in the colonies who does not wish they were born Spanish?</string>
        <string _locid="39966">You may send the settlers this way if you want them to live beyond today.</string>
        <string _locid="39967">You may want to use that wood to build coffins for your men.</string>
        <string _locid="39968">It won't be long before that wood is fueling your pyre.</string>
        <string _locid="39969">A wall? Is this to keep the enemy out or your soldiers in?</string>
        <string _locid="39970">No wall can protect you from the sting of Spanish steel.</string>
        <string _locid="39971">See how the locals flock to me? They will be your undoing.</string>
        <string _locid="39972">It would seem the natives have chosen to support the winning side.</string>
        <string _locid="39973">Such bounty will give me the advantage I need to crush you.</string>
        <string _locid="39974">Are you afraid to get your own trade site for fear I will destroy it?</string>
        <string _locid="39975">Look at this. More riches for the Spanish cause.</string>
        <string _locid="39976">The treasures practically jump at me. </string>
        <string _locid="39977">Are you jealous that such a fine treasure is mine?</string>
        <string _locid="39978">This coin will pay for many Spanish soldiers.</string>
        <string _locid="39979">Look at all of this coin. Do you need to borrow some?</string>
        <string _locid="39980">Wherever will I store all of this food?</string>
        <string _locid="39981">I may need to build another town center to store all of this food.</string>
        <string _locid="39982">Oh look. You have forgotten one. I will take care of it.</string>
        <string _locid="39983">Is your explorer so blind as to miss things right under his very nose?</string>
        <string _locid="39984">You should go to the tavern and tell your explorer to get started soon.</string>
        <string _locid="39985">Was that your explorer I saw napping in a field?</string>
        <string _locid="39986">This New World holds many treasures. It is too bad that you do not.</string>
        <string _locid="39987">These natives have chosen to side with the victors.</string>
        <string _locid="39988">The natives here will enjoy victory when we crush you.</string>
        <string _locid="39989">Who wouldn't want to join a queen as lovely as I am?</string>
        <string _locid="39990">It is good that these people come work for me, rather than dying in your town.</string>
        <string _locid="39991">This wood will make arrows to pierce your very heart.</string>
        <string _locid="39992">Should I use this wood to build or destroy?</string>
        <string _locid="39993">Those people will not help you in the long run.</string>
        <string _locid="39994">It would be a shame if someone were to come along and knock that post down.</string>
        <string _locid="39995">That is a cute trade site. I am going to enjoy watching it burn.</string>
        <string _locid="39996">Don't think that trade site will give you any advantage.</string>
        <string _locid="39997">An interesting tactic, but you should have worried about protecting your towns.</string>
        <string _locid="39998">What good is this when you have no army to protect them?</string>
        <string _locid="39999">Do you hear that? That is the clock ticking down on your defeat.</string>
        <string _locid="40000">Don't mind those posts. They are only going to win us the game.</string>
        <string _locid="40001">Whatever happened to you? I thought you used to be somebody.</string>
        <string _locid="40002">Don't worry. That happens to lots of people. I guess.</string>
        <string _locid="40003">I see you have come a long way - a long way to die.</string>
        <string _locid="40004">You have improved since the last time we met. But you will still taste my boot heel.</string>
        <string _locid="40005">You have gained much experience since I saw you last. But you have not learned how to win.</string>
        <string _locid="40006">That experience won't help you. In fact, it will only make my victory all the sweeter.</string>
        <string _locid="40007">Bonuses like this can only hasten your destruction.</string>
        <string _locid="40008">This treasure has already been invested in the weapons I will use to demolish your puny nation.</string>
        <string _locid="40009">Such a discovery is unique! Surely you have nothing like it.</string>
        <string _locid="40010">Go ahead, scavenge while you can.</string>
        <string _locid="40011">Your men rummage through the brush like rodents, looking for tasty tidbits. Soon I bring a bayonet for you to bite on instead.</string>
        <string _locid="40012">You gather loot like a vulture, instead of soaring like the Russian eagle.</string>
        <string _locid="40013">You are off to a quick start, but the outcome is not in doubt.</string>
        <string _locid="40014">Such talent at killing bandits and wild animals. We'll see how you do against my disciplined army. </string>
        <string _locid="40015">Your lack of skill at treasure hunting probably demonstrates that you will be surprised by the size of my army.</string>
        <string _locid="40016">That treasure was MINE. You will regret this, little one.</string>
        <string _locid="40017">I gather treasure where I please, because I know you cannot stop me.</string>
        <string _locid="40018">Your primitive town structure is proof of your incompetence. Your soldiers will still be using sticks and knives while mine have gunpowder.</string>
        <string _locid="40019">Your high technology will remain but a bittersweet memory  when my Cossacks burn your town.</string>
        <string _locid="40020">Your Age advancement is too little, too late.</string>
        <string _locid="40021">Such speedy advancement in Age means you are neglecting military production. You shall learn the hard way how wrong your priorities are.</string>
        <string _locid="40022">Do not take it too hard when my men raze your fine new buildings.</string>
        <string _locid="40023">While you progress in Age, I sharpen my saber. A blade through the heart kills even the most advanced soldier type.</string>
        <string _locid="40024">My armies will crush you with their superior technology.</string>
        <string _locid="40025">I see your town. I can already hear my armies march down your streets.</string>
        <string _locid="40026">Your towns are so close; like little lambs huddled together in fear.</string>
        <string _locid="40027">You have rashly isolated your town. I can now crush you and your ally piecemeal.</string>
        <string _locid="40028">I have saved my explorer. Now I shall punish you for his temporary captivity. </string>
        <string _locid="40029">Yes you wounded my explorer, but now he is back, and thirsting for revenge. </string>
        <string _locid="40030">You may have caught my explorer, but you could not keep him.</string>
        <string _locid="40031">The natives are foolish to ally with your cause.</string>
        <string _locid="40032">Is THAT your army? It's so small ... it must be a decoy. </string>
        <string _locid="40033">That force seems too big for a band of scouts. You must think it is an army.</string>
        <string _locid="40034">You are letting your men wander too far from home. Did they lose their way?</string>
        <string _locid="40035">I see your army. Sadly, it's not large enough to merit concern.</string>
        <string _locid="40036">I have spotted your invasion force. Now I can cut it off and destroy it. </string>
        <string _locid="40037">There you are. Bring on your puny assault! I am ready. </string>
        <string _locid="40038">I see your invading army. So large ... your home base must be defenseless! </string>
        <string _locid="40039">Your large but undisciplined mass of soldiers does not frighten me. </string>
        <string _locid="40040">I see you're hoping to invade me. I must stop you cold.</string>
        <string _locid="40041">Attacking my settlers?! You will pay for this.</string>
        <string _locid="40042">Apparently your men are only good against unarmed civilians. </string>
        <string _locid="40043">My economy is powerful enough to withstand your pinpricks.</string>
        <string _locid="40044">This isn't right ... the war was supposed to be in YOUR town.</string>
        <string _locid="40045">What are you doing? How can you be HERE? No!</string>
        <string _locid="40046">You cannot take the credit for this victory. I'm sure I was betrayed by my own jealous underlings.</string>
        <string _locid="40047">This may not be the end, but it is at least the beginning of the end.</string>
        <string _locid="40048">Surrender now to avoid the humiliation of being utterly crushed.</string>
        <string _locid="40049">We will crush every inch of your civilization under our boots.</string>
        <string _locid="40050">My sword rusts from disuse. Are you ever going to attack?</string>
        <string _locid="40051">Enjoy the lull. My troops train diligently while you idle away your future.</string>
        <string _locid="40052">Are you still there?</string>
        <string _locid="40053">I intend to crush the enemy's outlying base here.</string>
        <string _locid="40054">Sir! Hands off the discoveries near my town. They are for me! </string>
        <string _locid="40055">I can't afford to do that ... yet.</string>
        <string _locid="40056">You will have to wait. Please ask again later.</string>
        <string _locid="40057">I have no money, so I cannot assist you.</string>
        <string _locid="40058">I do not have an army yet, or I would rush to your aid.</string>
        <string _locid="40059">You will have to fight on your own for the nonce. I cannot help.</string>
        <string _locid="40060">Wait until I build an army!</string>
        <string _locid="40061">Soon I will have a mighty army. But not yet.</string>
        <string _locid="40062">My army is not yet large enough to help you.</string>
        <string _locid="40063">I am not prepared to attack the enemy yet.</string>
        <string _locid="40064">Yes! Brilliant! </string>
        <string _locid="40065">Stealing my treasure? I suppose we ARE on the same side. Aren't we?</string>
        <string _locid="40066">At once!</string>
        <string _locid="40067">Of course!</string>
        <string _locid="40068">That action is forbidden to me.</string>
        <string _locid="40069">I am not able to follow your orders.</string>
        <string _locid="40070">Yes - artillery to demolish his buildings, plus a few horsemen to run down his settlers. </string>
        <string _locid="40071">Hmm. Artillery fortified by my sturdy infantry should be well-nigh unbeatable! </string>
        <string _locid="40072">Yes, artillery! An unstoppable barrage of cannonball! </string>
        <string _locid="40073">With enough cannon we can sweep the enemy away.</string>
        <string _locid="40074">We Russians are good at training cavalry. Perhaps this is a job for my Cossacks ... and of course some artillery to knock down any annoying infantry that might get in our way.</string>
        <string _locid="40075">Horsemen to trample the foe beneath their hooves! Plus some infantry to clean up anything that survives.</string>
        <string _locid="40076">Excellent. You are already on your way! </string>
        <string _locid="40077">I shall train infantry. Infantry and a few artillery pieces for show.</string>
        <string _locid="40078">Hordes of infantry is what we Russians are best at producing. A few cavalry to fill in the cracks and we will have a fine force.</string>
        <string _locid="40079">Endless waves of horsemen from the steppes will be a fine sight.</string>
        <string _locid="40080">Cavalry are the answer to our problems.</string>
        <string _locid="40081">You are right. I need more infantry. One can never have enough.</string>
        <string _locid="40082">I shall train an endless horde of infantry.</string>
        <string _locid="40083">Ha! A free settler! </string>
        <string _locid="40084">You are rich!</string>
        <string _locid="40085">Food is always welcome.</string>
        <string _locid="40086">You know - free warriors like that make excellent cannon fodder.</string>
        <string _locid="40087">I was hoping to capture the first treasure. But I am just as happy that it is you.</string>
        <string _locid="40088">Even lowly wood can be put to use in your war machine.</string>
        <string _locid="40089">Hurrah! I got a free settler!</string>
        <string _locid="40090">Gold here for the taking!</string>
        <string _locid="40091">This New World is a land of plenty, overflowing with food.</string>
        <string _locid="40092">That was a nice bonus for my army.</string>
        <string _locid="40093">I am glad I found this wood before the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40094">That is the kind of battle I like! Lots of action and in the end, myself victorious.</string>
        <string _locid="40095">A close-fought struggle but, in the end, my will proved the stronger.</string>
        <string _locid="40096">A balanced fight. Either side could have won, but I did.</string>
        <string _locid="40097">They never had a chance.</string>
        <string _locid="40098">You are skilled at gathering treasures. Keep it up.</string>
        <string _locid="40099">I just rolled right over them. Ha!</string>
        <string _locid="40100">I love it when a battle goes smoothly.</string>
        <string _locid="40101">These walls will stop almost anything!</string>
        <string _locid="40102">Ha! Let the enemy try to come through THESE walls!</string>
        <string _locid="40103">Quickly! We must destroy one of the enemy posts or all is lost!</string>
        <string _locid="40104">Curse their eyes! The enemy has four trading posts. They cannot win by main strength, so they are trying to do so with cunning.</string>
        <string _locid="40105">Building four posts is not the most glorious way to win a war, but it is certainly effective.</string>
        <string _locid="40106">They have to come to us now to keep us from winning. Let us prepare an ambush.</string>
        <string _locid="40107">I see that you have been effective in multiplayer lately! It gives me confidence that we shall conquer today.</string>
        <string _locid="40108">Your multiplayer rating is up from last time we played! It is good to have a competent ally such as yourself.</string>
        <string _locid="40109">Your greed in taking the treasures does my old heart good.</string>
        <string _locid="40110">Hmm. I see by your multiplayer score that you have been having trouble lately. Well, perhaps this fight will turn things around for you.</string>
        <string _locid="40111">Your multiplayer rating makes it clear that you have been suffering defeats. Do not dwell on the past! The future belongs to us!</string>
        <string _locid="40112">I see by the size of your Home City that you have done some growing up! Excellent!</string>
        <string _locid="40113">How strong your Home City looks this time. I am impressed.</string>
        <string _locid="40114">We were here last time. I guess we know the ins and outs of this map by now.</string>
        <string _locid="40115">Don't let me down like you did last time.</string>
        <string _locid="40116">This time for sure! Victory or death!</string>
        <string _locid="40117">Hurrah! It is you again. Last time we won, and that bodes well for this time.</string>
        <string _locid="40118">Thank you for being the backbone of our army last time we were allied. This time I vow to be stronger.</string>
        <string _locid="40119">Do not make me do all the work like last time.</string>
        <string _locid="40120">Do not leave all the work in making discoveries to me. You need to gather your fair share.</string>
        <string _locid="40121">You taught me a hard lesson last game. See how well I've learned from your example.</string>
        <string _locid="40122">Do not worry. I will be just as aggressive on your behalf as I was trying to defeat you.</string>
        <string _locid="40123">Those knaves! Let us seek immediate retribution upon their bodies. They will pay for their insolence!</string>
        <string _locid="40124">The foe may have gotten the first native alliance, but they will not have the last one.</string>
        <string _locid="40125">Why are you just sitting there? The enemy has a native alliance. And we do not!</string>
        <string _locid="40126">Ah, the enemy has a trading post. That should be a juicy nugget for our raiders.</string>
        <string _locid="40127">An enemy trading post? Already? They are more competent that I thought.</string>
        <string _locid="40128">They keep getting more native allies. This gives us more juicy targets to pick from for our attacks.</string>
        <string _locid="40129">Our foe seems very interested in trade. Perhaps that indicates he would lose spirit if we were to strike at them.</string>
        <string _locid="40130">Yes! A neverending stream of native warriors!</string>
        <string _locid="40131">Don't you want some of the treasures too?</string>
        <string _locid="40132">With the wealth we earn from trade we can bury our foes.</string>
        <string _locid="40133">Good, good - now that we have native allies, let us train as many as possible before the enemy does something about it.</string>
        <string _locid="40134">The enemy are slow and weak. That is why we were able to conquer this trade route first.</string>
        <string _locid="40135">The enemy's attempt to defeat us with their puny four of a kind has been crushed under my boot heel.</string>
        <string _locid="40136">With these native warriors I can swamp my foe by sheer numbers.</string>
        <string _locid="40137">Money greases the wheels of warfare. That is what this trading post is for.</string>
        <string _locid="40138">If one native ally is good, more are better!</string>
        <string _locid="40139">If one trading post is good, more are better!</string>
        <string _locid="40140">This fight may be tougher than the last one, but I am tougher, too!</string>
        <string _locid="40141">I see you have decided to face weaker opposition than last time. That is fine - I have nothing against massacres.</string>
        <string _locid="40142">I took this treasure since you had not bothered to do so yourself. Too busy no doubt.</string>
        <string _locid="40143">Only one minute! Inconceivable! Attack attack attack for we are at the critical moment! </string>
        <string _locid="40144">Ha! We have them by the short hairs now. One minute left before our enemy's total humiliation! </string>
        <string _locid="40145">Just one short minute and the game ends. Our foe is doomed and it is all because of my ... er ... I mean "our" power.</string>
        <string _locid="40146">I have crushed our common foe's attempt to subvert the natives.</string>
        <string _locid="40147">What pleasure to see his town crumble as his peasants try hopelessly to flee.</string>
        <string _locid="40148">I love razing towns. It's what I do best.</string>
        <string _locid="40149">I have ruined his trading route.</string>
        <string _locid="40150">My troops have been repulsed by his defenses - temporarily.</string>
        <string _locid="40151">I cannot believe I didn't destroy his native alliance. What has gone wrong?</string>
        <string _locid="40152">His town still stands, but at least we hurt him.</string>
        <string _locid="40153">You did not need this treasure, obviously, since otherwise you would have taken it by now.</string>
        <string _locid="40154">Well, it was only a trading post. Nothing too critical.</string>
        <string _locid="40155">That action is totally impossible.</string>
        <string _locid="40156">Hurry, hurry! Rescue my people here!</string>
        <string _locid="40157">A disaster is in the brewing! We must rush all available troops to this place!</string>
        <string _locid="40158">Do not kill all the enemy before I get there!</string>
        <string _locid="40159">Save some for me!</string>
        <string _locid="40160">I want to kill some of them too! My men are rushing to your side.</string>
        <string _locid="40161">Keep fighting. We are almost there.</string>
        <string _locid="40162">Do not worry about how many men YOU lose. My men will replace your fallen. Just worry about how many of THEM you slay.</string>
        <string _locid="40163">With me by your side, we will drive off the enemy in confusion and defeat.</string>
        <string _locid="40164">I have commanded an attack at this position.</string>
        <string _locid="40165">My explorer will not be useful for a time. When he returns, I shall punish him severely.</string>
        <string _locid="40166">Excellent! A worthy ally. Our foes have no chance.</string>
        <string _locid="40167">In trying to prepare my unstoppable army, I have neglected my economy. I need some coin right now to rectify affairs.</string>
        <string _locid="40168">Quickly, some coin! If it will not cripple you.</string>
        <string _locid="40169">My men cannot fight without food. Do you have any you can lend to me?</string>
        <string _locid="40170">My supply lines are barren of food. I need it badly.</string>
        <string _locid="40171">Without more wood, my progress will stop indefinitely. Do you have some?</string>
        <string _locid="40172">I have a wood shortage. Kindly send some along.</string>
        <string _locid="40173">Sound the war cry! Charge! </string>
        <string _locid="40174">Onward my soldiers! No quarter! </string>
        <string _locid="40175">Death! Death to all who would stand in our way! </string>
        <string _locid="40176">My explorer is incapacitated. Fortunately it is only temporary.</string>
        <string _locid="40177">Your men came in the nick of time.</string>
        <string _locid="40178">Together we put the enemy to flight!</string>
        <string _locid="40179">We teamed up to rout the foe. Now let us take the battle to HIS base.</string>
        <string _locid="40180">So shall all our enemies die!</string>
        <string _locid="40181">Now we have them on the run! Keep attacking!</string>
        <string _locid="40182">Look at them take to their heels! The cowards!</string>
        <string _locid="40183">I know just how to spend this.</string>
        <string _locid="40184">With this shipment, I can prepare a mountain of pain for the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40185">My men will eat well tonight.</string>
        <string _locid="40186">I can use this wood for many things -- all of which will harm our foe.</string>
        <string _locid="40187">My explorer has failed us both. He shall pay.</string>
        <string _locid="40188">I hate advising anyone to retreat, but in this case, I think it is the wisest course.</string>
        <string _locid="40189">Save your troops for a fight you can win! This battle is lost.</string>
        <string _locid="40190">You need to send the enemy flying with cannonballs! Roll out the artillery! </string>
        <string _locid="40191">Artillery is the God of war! Forge more cannon! </string>
        <string _locid="40192">Flash your sabers above the foe! Gallop to the charge! You'll need many more horsemen than now. </string>
        <string _locid="40193">The enemy cannot stand up to a charge. Send in the cavalry! Hmm ... I see that you need to train and equip some first.</string>
        <string _locid="40194">How can you massacre the enemy with volleys of gunfire or massed bayonet charges if you do not have any infantry?</string>
        <string _locid="40195">Don't you have some kind of building you can use to train infantry? You clearly need far more of them.</string>
        <string _locid="40196">I detest the thought of surrendering to these rascals. Can you see anything else we might try?</string>
        <string _locid="40197">I see no hope ahead, no sun on the horizon. This defeat chokes me like gall, but what else can we do but resign?</string>
        <string _locid="40198">We are doomed. Doomed! Why do you force us to fight on?</string>
        <string _locid="40199">We are going to have peace, even if we have to fight for it.</string>
        <string _locid="40200">Wars never hurt anybody. Except the people who die.</string>
        <string _locid="40201">We train our men not simply to endure battle, but to long for it.</string>
        <string _locid="40202">Chaaaarge!</string>
        <string _locid="40203">Die, poltroon!</string>
        <string _locid="40204">Feel my steel!</string>
        <string _locid="40205">I see I will have to fight all the harder.</string>
        <string _locid="40206">I do not need gold to finish you off.</string>
        <string _locid="40207">Food? I sneer at it. Wood and coin drive my war machine.</string>
        <string _locid="40208">Another warrior for my men to kill.</string>
        <string _locid="40209">Our armies are scattered, our towns destroyed, our hopes dashed. But though no hope is left, we shall never surrender! Never! Do you hear, our enemies? You will have to hunt us down and kill us one by one.</string>
        <string _locid="40210">Wood - what a useless resource.</string>
        <string _locid="40211">See how my population swells?</string>
        <string _locid="40212">This coin is being used to buy powder and shot which will be fired directly at you!</string>
        <string _locid="40213">This food is being used immediately to train soldiers to attack your puny base.</string>
        <string _locid="40214">Free soldiers! The best kind!</string>
        <string _locid="40215">This wood will be used to construct blockhouses to train my army.</string>
        <string _locid="40216">That is the way I like fights. Bloody, straightforward, and ending with me on top.</string>
        <string _locid="40217">You never stood a chance.</string>
        <string _locid="40218">Curse you! I thought I had you that time!</string>
        <string _locid="40219">How did you pull that off? Your army was all but defeated!</string>
        <string _locid="40220">Use this coin to advance our great cause.</string>
        <string _locid="40221">We have not fought for a quite a while. Did it take that long to steel yourself to the task of attempting to defeat me?</string>
        <string _locid="40222">We have not met one another for some time. But it seems from your multiplayer rating that your skills have not improved much.</string>
        <string _locid="40223">Your Home City is a lot bigger than the last time we met. Do not think it will save you.</string>
        <string _locid="40224">I liked this map the last time we played. It's a good map.</string>
        <string _locid="40225">I can defeat you even if you have made the situation more favorable to you than our last encounter.</string>
        <string _locid="40226">You are doomed. You have foolishly made me, your enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40227">You would settle for the kind of puny victory you get by waiting out a timer? I am almost ashamed to be fighting you.</string>
        <string _locid="40228">You think just because a few ragged native tribes have joined your side you'll be able to field a more effective army? Well ... perhaps you are right.</string>
        <string _locid="40229">Your multiplicity of trade routes shows that you waste your time on trivialities. I stick to the essentials.</string>
        <string _locid="40230">Ha! I knew you wouldn't be able to pull it off! Now the REAL fight begins.</string>
        <string _locid="40231">Here is good hearty Russian food to fortify your nation.</string>
        <string _locid="40232">What?! My native allies! You will pay for this!</string>
        <string _locid="40233">How can you fight on when I am able to destroy your town centers as I please?</string>
        <string _locid="40234">Ah, I love the smell of burning trading posts.</string>
        <string _locid="40235">My native warriors can easily trounce yours. Especially since you do not have any yet, you fool.</string>
        <string _locid="40236">This trade route will carry my nation directly to your vulnerable heart.</string>
        <string _locid="40237">Building walls I see. You are wise to fear me.</string>
        <string _locid="40238">A true soldier never walls in.</string>
        <string _locid="40239">You won't hold that native village for long. I will see to that.</string>
        <string _locid="40240">You may have built on the first trade route, but you have not built the last.</string>
        <string _locid="40241">What?! My native allies! You'll pay for this!</string>
        <string _locid="40242">The endless taiga of Russia is filled with trees. Here is wood from it to boost your might.</string>
        <string _locid="40243">I needed that trading post! You will be sorry you attacked it.</string>
        <string _locid="40244">My town! No!</string>
        <string _locid="40245">Too bad. Now I will have to crush you the old-fashioned way.</string>
        <string _locid="40246">By raising the difficulty since last time, you have unleashed powerful Russian forces you did not expect!</string>
        <string _locid="40247">Weakling! I see you needed to play at a feebler difficulty level. This indicates that I should have an easy victory over you.</string>
        <string _locid="40248">Ha ha! The final nails in your coffin are being hammered in right now.</string>
        <string _locid="40249">I have not lost yet!</string>
        <string _locid="40250">It is all over but the victory parade now. Ha!</string>
        <string _locid="40251">Trying to steal my loot, eh? I have taught your thieving troops a lesson.</string>
        <string _locid="40252">Your puny effort to raid my town is futile.</string>
        <string _locid="40253">I will not let the foe destroy this building! </string>
        <string _locid="40254">Your men seem to lack direction. Where are they going?</string>
        <string _locid="40255">Your explorer cannot remain concealed from me! </string>
        <string _locid="40256">It will be a pleasure to crush you beneath my boot heel.</string>
        <string _locid="40257">This kind of a fight suits me just fine. Lots of wild action. Spread death, my men!</string>
        <string _locid="40258">Good, good. Wall in - that will free up extra troops that you can take to the enemy's town.</string>
        <string _locid="40259">Those walls should stop all but the most vigorous enemy assault.</string>
        <string _locid="40260">The British are no better than dead dogs by now.</string>
        <string _locid="40261">The British soldiers are strong ... perhaps too strong.</string>
        <string _locid="40262">Soon we will be able to finish off the Netherlands contingent.</string>
        <string _locid="40263">The Dutch fight like demons.</string>
        <string _locid="40264">My men will die rather than let this post fall to the foe.</string>
        <string _locid="40265">The French are helpless before us.</string>
        <string _locid="40266">The French are a dangerous foe. We must be ready for them.</string>
        <string _locid="40267">We Russians have long hated the Germans. It feels good to see them doing down before us.</string>
        <string _locid="40268">We Russians have long hated the Germans. It is like drinking poison to see them doing so well.</string>
        <string _locid="40269">We have almost wiped out the Ottomans. If only getting a warm water port for Holy Mother Russia would be so easy back in Europe.</string>
        <string _locid="40270">We Russians have been fighting the Turks for centuries. Who knows better than us how difficult they are to beat?</string>
        <string _locid="40271">A few more hammerblows and the Portuguese will be out of this game.</string>
        <string _locid="40272">The Portuguese ... I had never dreamed that such a small nation could hold such dangerous soldiers.</string>
        <string _locid="40273">Ha! Now we see at last who is the REAL Tsar of all the Russia! </string>
        <string _locid="40274">It is too bad that we are opposed by my brother Russians. It makes the fight less of a massacre than I prefer.</string>
        <string _locid="40275">So bold. But they do not expect me to attack HERE!</string>
        <string _locid="40276">This native village is OURS. I shall keep it for us.</string>
        <string _locid="40277">I knew the Spanish would not prove much of an obstacle.</string>
        <string _locid="40278">The Spanish are so effective on the battlefield. Perhaps we should be focusing better on them.</string>
        <string _locid="40279">The cursed enemy has somehow amassed superior forces! Hurry! Send help! </string>
        <string _locid="40280">Our war is in a downward spiral. Even your strength may not be enough to counteract my weakness.</string>
        <string _locid="40281">The cursed British! Can nothing stop them?</string>
        <string _locid="40282">The enemy advance on every front. But the British foe is not so strong as the rest. Let us destroy him at least.</string>
        <string _locid="40283">Russia is so much vaster than the Netherlands. How can the Dutch be winning?</string>
        <string _locid="40284">If we do nothing, we lose. Let's hit the Dutch hard and fast and see if things look better.</string>
        <string _locid="40285">The French seem everywhere at once. What can I do against such skill?</string>
        <string _locid="40286">We may not win, but let us strike back! The French are our foe's weak spot. Strike! </string>
        <string _locid="40287">My men will garrison this town.</string>
        <string _locid="40288">The Germans. Always invading Russia. Well, Russia may lose this war, but first, let us invade the Germans for a change!</string>
        <string _locid="40289">Blunderer! Knave! Not just your empire, but my own has been destroyed by your clumsiness!</string>
        <string _locid="40290">Resign at once you poltroon! I am better off without your bungling! </string>
        <string _locid="40291">The hated Turks! There are too many of them! At least we can go down fighting.</string>
        <string _locid="40292">The war does not go well, but the Ottomans are not the ones beating us. Let us crush the hated Turks before the end.</string>
        <string _locid="40293">How can a nation as puny as Portugal be so strong in war? It seems inconceivable! </string>
        <string _locid="40294">Portugal is a small nation, and I hope weak. Let us aim our blows at them for now and see where it leads us.</string>
        <string _locid="40295">I should have known better than to take on Russia as my enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40296">The war does not go well, but at least I have proven stronger than the enemy Russians. Let us at least strike them down before the end.</string>
        <string _locid="40297">This trading post belongs to us, and us alone. I shall not relinquish it to the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40298">Spain is far from Russia. I had never encountered them before, and neither had my troops. I am dismayed by their prowess. </string>
        <string _locid="40299">I do not like the way this is going. But ... perhaps there is hope if only we can destroy the Spanish. They seem vulnerable.</string>
        <string _locid="40300">We should have crushed them sooner. Now they have called on their friends for help.</string>
        <string _locid="40301">Yet another army?! This may be too much for even me to handle.</string>
        <string _locid="40302">Now that your men fight alongside mine, we can turn the battle's tide and crush the foeman beneath our boot heel! </string>
        <string _locid="40303">Excellent! Now that our armies have joined up, the enemy has no chance here.</string>
        <string _locid="40304">Hurrah! The enemy is in retreat. Now we shall strike while the iron is hot! </string>
        <string _locid="40305">Now we have them where we want them! Attack, attack, attack! </string>
        <string _locid="40306">Now we have the power to win this war! No mercy! </string>
        <string _locid="40307">We still have the edge in this war. No thanks to you.</string>
        <string _locid="40308">I can send coin to you for as long as you need it.</string>
        <string _locid="40309">Must I do everything myself? I have practically won this war alone. Come now, turn things around! </string>
        <string _locid="40310">I knew I could have crushed them alone, but it would have been much easier if you had helped out more.</string>
        <string _locid="40311">The enemy is crushed, thanks to us. Well ... mostly thanks to you.</string>
        <string _locid="40312">Now we have them! Keep up the pressure. I am proud to have you as the stronger ally! </string>
        <string _locid="40313">Together we are taking the war to the enemy. At least I am able to help! </string>
        <string _locid="40314">Ha! I was too strong for you so you had to call for your big brother to come help! Coward! </string>
        <string _locid="40315">What is this? You need help to fight me? Can't do it alone, can you? Chicken! </string>
        <string _locid="40316">Ha! Now together we will crush your puny force! </string>
        <string _locid="40317">You cannot stand against us both. No human could! </string>
        <string _locid="40318">Now THIS is the kind of battle I like! Vast numbers of soldiers, with a variety of commanders, all pushed together into the scrim! Have at you! </string>
        <string _locid="40319">I will keep a stream of rations coming to you as long as you require it.</string>
        <string _locid="40320">I see you have banded together in hopes of forestalling your doom. It will not help you. You see OUR armies have teamed up as well.</string>
        <string _locid="40321">My armies ... crushed. My town ... a burning ruin. It is hopeless. I must offer my surrender.</string>
        <string _locid="40324">My woodsmen will send lumber so long as you lack it.</string>
        <string _locid="40325">War to the hilt! Let us combine our forces to destroy the enemy here.</string>
        <string _locid="40326">The Russian bear shall hold sway here. And you too, should you accompany me. </string>
        <string _locid="40327">Now is the time to unleash the dogs of war. Onward, soldiers of holy mother Russia! </string>
        <string _locid="40328">Soon I shall hold sway over these natives, instead of our hated foe! </string>
        <string _locid="40329">My explorer has returned! Now the enemy shall pay for his insolence.</string>
        <string _locid="40330">When I wreck this trading post, the enemy will no longer have his native friends to shelter behind.</string>
        <string _locid="40331">Our foe does not deserve the benefits of trade. I shall wreck his post here. </string>
        <string _locid="40332">Cutting off the enemy's resources is as effective as killing his soldiers. I am going to strangle him by destroying this trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="40333">My empire expands. I shall build a forward base of operations at this site.</string>
        <string _locid="40334">I have commanded a base to be made here, to menace the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40335">I am creating a town center here.</string>
        <string _locid="40336">My empire will expand by constructing a new town at this place.</string>
        <string _locid="40337">I need more territory under my control. I will construct a town here.</string>
        <string _locid="40338">I am adding these natives to our empire.</string>
        <string _locid="40339">Native soldiers will swell the ranks of my army.</string>
        <string _locid="40340">I want to have natives among my troops.</string>
        <string _locid="40341">I see I need the benefits of trade.</string>
        <string _locid="40342">Gold is as good a weapon as a sword, sometimes.</string>
        <string _locid="40343">By occupying a trading site, I can lure out the enemy's forces.</string>
        <string _locid="40344">I am going to hit them where they are weakest - their settlers! </string>
        <string _locid="40345">Without resources, their army withers on the vine. I am off to kill their settlers!</string>
        <string _locid="40346">The Tsar of all the Russians thanks you for your help in bringing back our explorer. </string>
        <string _locid="40347">I am pleased by your efforts on our behalf. </string>
        <string _locid="40348">I am not ungrateful for your assistance.</string>
        <string _locid="40349">Curse the enemy! He has forced me to ransom my explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="40350">Congratulations in so effectively looting this New World.</string>
        <string _locid="40351">Ah good. You are making fine use of your scouts.</string>
        <string _locid="40352">The only thing worse than sending gold to the enemy is not having my explorer here where I need him.</string>
        <string _locid="40353">The foe's puny efforts to deny us the use of my explorer have utterly failed. He is back. </string>
        <string _locid="40354">As usual, the enemy's plans have been thwarted. My explorer has returned to health. </string>
        <string _locid="40355">Our enemy is trying to get native help. I trust it will avail him nothing. </string>
        <string _locid="40356">Even the natives won't be able to save our foe from his destined doom.</string>
        <string _locid="40357">Look at this! An enemy town, but with no defending army! A meaty prize if you can take it.</string>
        <string _locid="40358">The enemy does not realize we know about this town - it's devoid of protection. Let's burn it to the ground!</string>
        <string _locid="40359">The fool! He has built a town without a barracks! Send in the cavalry! </string>
        <string _locid="40360">No barracks? He cannot produce infantry here! Attack quickly before he realizes his blunder.</string>
        <string _locid="40361">He has no stable in this town. Our artillery can bombard it with impunity! </string>
        <string _locid="40362">This will get its own room in the Tsar's Palace.</string>
        <string _locid="40363">I see he has no stable here. Attack at once with a barrage!</string>
        <string _locid="40364">They have killed my explorer! No mercy for the villain! </string>
        <string _locid="40365">Those knaves have killed my explorer. It is an insult to us both!</string>
        <string _locid="40366">What an offense against nature! Those poltroons have assassinated my explorer!</string>
        <string _locid="40367">This wilderness has killed my explorer! </string>
        <string _locid="40368">What a deadly place this New World can be! It's put paid to my efforts to scout for the time being.</string>
        <string _locid="40369">My explorer! No!</string>
        <string _locid="40370">You cannot defeat me alone, so you seek native allies? They will do you no good in the end.</string>
        <string _locid="40371">This town is a ripe plum for the taking.</string>
        <string _locid="40372">Now I know where you are hiding. Your town shall be my prey. </string>
        <string _locid="40373">See what I have found?</string>
        <string _locid="40374">Could you not see how near your ally was? You built practically on his doorstep, leaving the entire rest of the map for me to exploit!</string>
        <string _locid="40375">You are doing so well, my friend. Perhaps this means you can spare a few resources for me to Age up as well?</string>
        <string _locid="40376">Now that you have access to more powerful troops, my role must temporarily be that of support.</string>
        <string _locid="40377">Hmm. I will not be able to Age up as quickly as you have done.</string>
        <string _locid="40378">You are still in the previous Age? I hope you know what you are about.</string>
        <string _locid="40379">Hurry and Age up! You need to catch up to me. </string>
        <string _locid="40380">A fine job of advancement. Do not forget you will need troops to go along with your new upgrades and researches.</string>
        <string _locid="40381">Leaping up in Age! Good, good. Put your technological edge to good use.</string>
        <string _locid="40382">At last! We will not have to endure the contempt of our foes any longer. </string>
        <string _locid="40383">You certainly took a long time to get to Colonial. I trust that means you have a huge army waiting somewhere. </string>
        <string _locid="40384">I am gaining wealth for both of us.</string>
        <string _locid="40385">Do you need some kind of help? You are STILL not Colonial! </string>
        <string _locid="40386">What is the problem? You cannot build a good army in the Discovery Age!</string>
        <string _locid="40387">I see you're still in the previous Age from me. Have you even discovered gunpowder yet?</string>
        <string _locid="40388">Speed in advancement to Colonial Age will not matter in the long run.</string>
        <string _locid="40389">It's about time you reached Colonial. Now you can train a few troops before I devastate your countryside.</string>
        <string _locid="40390">It is astounding that anyone could advance through the Ages so slowly!</string>
        <string _locid="40391">Your luck will not hold. Yes, you have acquired the first treasure, but the bulk of the rest will fall to me.</string>
        <string _locid="40392">Pick up treasures while you can. When my soldiers march into your town, it will be too late.</string>
        <string _locid="40393">I have vastly more loot than you. My army and economy will also be vaster than yours.</string>
        <string _locid="40394">Your town is so feeble, you cannot even stop me from looting nearby treasure.</string>
        <string _locid="40395">Well my little upstart, I can't buy our way out of this one.</string>
        <string _locid="40396">Well my little upstart, stick with me and do as I do. Successes like these will become old-hat.</string>
        <string _locid="40397">Splurge a little on some cannon and you'll see much better results on the battlefield.</string>
        <string _locid="40398">The power and speed of horses on the battlefield is an amazing thing, you should try using it.</string>
        <string _locid="40399">Many military conflicts are won by infantry might. If you build some more you might witness this first hand.</string>
        <string _locid="40400">Ah my little upstart, you stand to lose more than you can handle </string>
        <string _locid="40401">Ah my little upstart, you stand to lose more than you will gain if you pursue that fight.</string>
        <string _locid="40402">If we win this conflict our enemies will surely recognize our power.</string>
        <string _locid="40403">Did your scouts not warn you of the strength of my forces? Well now you know to retreat when next we meet.</string>
        <string _locid="40404">My prowess on the battlefield is unmatched, it would be wise of you to respect it.</string>
        <string _locid="40405">Ah, my little upstart, throwing your troops into the mouth of a lion only feeds it and makes it stronger.</string>
        <string _locid="40406">As you can see, I did not become the leader of a strong nation without a strong military.</string>
        <string _locid="40407">My little upstart, soon you will learn true power is earned not imagined.</string>
        <string _locid="40408">Another victory for our side, soon this conflict will be over with.</string>
        <string _locid="40409">If you keep following my lead your nation may become as strong as mine.</string>
        <string _locid="40410">With some money in their pockets and a will to survive my soldiers can make miracles happen.</string>
        <string _locid="40411">I knew if I lost that battle you would lose hope my little upstart. So I turned the tide and won it for you.</string>
        <string _locid="40412">Ha-ha! Victory out of defeat.</string>
        <string _locid="40413">Continue with your build up my little upstart, I have this situation well under control.</string>
        <string _locid="40414">My forces are well paid and well trained, this battle should be short and favor my side.</string>
        <string _locid="40415">I thought about retreating to your forces before this battle but ...</string>
        <string _locid="40416">Ah my little upstart, I believe you may have turned this battle in our favor.</string>
        <string _locid="40417">This battle was mine to lose and with the reinforcements the enemy is bringing it looks like I shall.</string>
        <string _locid="40418">But of course.</string>
        <string _locid="40419">It shall be done.</string>
        <string _locid="40420">Right away.</string>
        <string _locid="40421">Very well, I shall use my wealth to purchase many large guns.</string>
        <string _locid="40422">The battlefield will be filled with my artillery and cavalry.</string>
        <string _locid="40423">The battlefield will be filled with my artillery and infantry.</string>
        <string _locid="40424">I know the abilities of cavalry well, I shall train many.</string>
        <string _locid="40425">Yes, cavalry backed by artillery, two very expensive units, but I can certainly afford them both.</string>
        <string _locid="40426">Cavalry followed by foot soldiers, I will begin training my force now.</string>
        <string _locid="40427">I shall use all my resources to mass an army of foot soldiers.</string>
        <string _locid="40428">I will soon have an army of infantry with some artillery mixed in for good measure.</string>
        <string _locid="40429">I will build a large infantry force and protect its flanks with smaller groups of cavalry.</string>
        <string _locid="40430">The wealth of my nation is being used in other ways, for now.</string>
        <string _locid="40431">I regret to inform you that I can not comply</string>
        <string _locid="40432">I must respectfully decline.</string>
        <string _locid="40433">I can not do as you ask for the time being.</string>
        <string _locid="40434">I know you are accustomed to seeing my great armies wielding their power on the field. But at this moment I have none.</string>
        <string _locid="40435">I am prohibited from doing such things.</string>
        <string _locid="40436">I do not have sufficient troops for that task.</string>
        <string _locid="40437">A minor setback, we will still be victorious in the end.</string>
        <string _locid="40438">The British are poor and weak, they should not be a threat for much longer.</string>
        <string _locid="40439">Rebels!! Their challenge to my Dutch rule shall be over soon.</string>
        <string _locid="40440">I believe the French will be nothing but a memory soon.</string>
        <string _locid="40441">I would have never thought the Germans would resign so easily but I think they will be forced to soon.</string>
        <string _locid="40442">The Ottomans are a worthy adversary but I think their days are numbered.</string>
        <string _locid="40443">I sense the Portuguese will not last much longer.</string>
        <string _locid="40444">I fear these nearby trees more than I fear those Russians.</string>
        <string _locid="40445">The Spanish don't pose much of a threat anymore they should resign soon.</string>
        <string _locid="40446">The British are a force to be reckoned with, I nominate you to do the reckoning.</string>
        <string _locid="40447">As usual the Dutch are wealthy and near unbeatable.</string>
        <string _locid="40448">We should make for the French or they might just ride right over us.</string>
        <string _locid="40449">The German army is a well oiled machine, it would be wise to fear them.</string>
        <string _locid="40450">As it stands right now the Ottomans may overpower us.</string>
        <string _locid="40451">I do not want to believe it but the Portuguese are a worthy opponent here in the New World.</string>
        <string _locid="40452">It seems the Russian forces are as fierce as their winters.</string>
        <string _locid="40453">The Spanish power may be unmatched in the New World, we will need to work together to defeat them.</string>
        <string _locid="40454">It seems your wealth and knowledge have surpassed mine would you mind sharing some of your good fortune?</string>
        <string _locid="40455">Ah my little upstart, I hope you haven't rushed up the Age too soon, it will be some time before my technology matches yours.</string>
        <string _locid="40456">I don't know how you advanced so soon but I hope you're full of surprises as good as this one.</string>
        <string _locid="40457">The enemy has formed an alliance with the natives here. They will help to defeat our forces.</string>
        <string _locid="40458">A powerful nation has both a strong economy and military but you need to advance an Age to even begin your military production.</string>
        <string _locid="40459">I hope someday soon your nation will match mine in Age advancement.</string>
        <string _locid="40460">Why are you still in that Age? Do you need resources?</string>
        <string _locid="40461">Advance the Age soon, I don't want barbarians for allies.</string>
        <string _locid="40462">Your quick Age advancement should strike some fear into our adversaries.</string>
        <string _locid="40463">Being the first to advance an Age can be very powerful if you use your new researches and units wisely.</string>
        <string _locid="40464">Wow! That was fast. Maybe I should just pay you to fight all my battles for me.</string>
        <string _locid="40465">If you wish to lead a powerful nation you need to keep up with the rest us my little upstart.</string>
        <string _locid="40466">Technology is the way of the future my little upstart, try not to stay in the past so long next time.</string>
        <string _locid="40467">Being last to Age two doesn't prove you're the weakest, but it doesn't disprove it either.</string>
        <string _locid="40468">I owe you a debt of gratitude for rescuing my explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="40469">Thank you for rescuing my explorer. I just can't seem to keep him out of trouble.</string>
        <string _locid="40470">My rescued explorer, myself, my nation, and his family send you many thanks for your efforts.</string>
        <string _locid="40471">I have crushed the bond between our enemy and his former native allies while thwarting attempt at an easy victory.</string>
        <string _locid="40472">The natives will no longer do the bidding of their evil ally.</string>
        <string _locid="40473">I have driven quite a wedge between our enemy and his native ally.</string>
        <string _locid="40474">My little upstart, sometimes you have to take your enemies apart piece by piece or in this case town by town ... hahaha</string>
        <string _locid="40475">This town is no more, we should plan our next move.</string>
        <string _locid="40476">They will get no more value from this trade post.</string>
        <string _locid="40477">The enemy barely survived my attacks but in the end their native trade post is still standing.</string>
        <string _locid="40478">That tyrant is more powerful than I thought and yes the enemy town still stands.</string>
        <string _locid="40479">I thought I could destroy our enemies' trade post but their strength was greater than I had anticipated.</string>
        <string _locid="40480">I'm not sure but I think I've lost my explorer. Oh wait! No no, he is dead again.</string>
        <string _locid="40481">My explorer has been killed again, I promise if you rescue him he will be more careful in the future.</string>
        <string _locid="40482">Hey my little upstart, when my explorer is up again could you leave a circle of your troops around him from now on? I'm sure he'll live longer that way.</string>
        <string _locid="40483">I hope the enemy doesn't find my explorer's body or he might think I'm weak for losing units before I even face him.</string>
        <string _locid="40484">My explorer has died, but not by the hand of my enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40485">Well my little upstart, I blame your lack of tactics for my defeat, I'm ready to resign at any moment.</string>
        <string _locid="40486">Maybe I can pay-off our enemies so they will grant us safe passage home after I offer my surrender.</string>
        <string _locid="40487">I can't deal with this matter on my own please send help.</string>
        <string _locid="40488">Things are getting out of hand in this area, could you come take care of it my little upstart.</string>
        <string _locid="40489">This is getting out of control! I need your troops in my town now!</string>
        <string _locid="40490">The enemy forces in my town are much larger then what I have to defend with. You might consider sending reinforcements.</string>
        <string _locid="40491">In my town, there-are-just-too-many ...</string>
        <string _locid="40492">I looked forward to many successes with you as my ally.</string>
        <string _locid="40493">It pleases me to see you are my ally, we should make short work of our enemies.</string>
        <string _locid="40494">Hello my little upstart, stick by me and you'll become more powerful than you can imagine.</string>
        <string _locid="40495">So you believe your skills have improved since last we met. Let's see how you fare this time and then I'll be the judge.</string>
        <string _locid="40496">I'll tone things down a bit and try to be a little less competitive.</string>
        <string _locid="40497">I'm still reeling from when last we met but I'm sure I'll fare much better this time with you as my ally.</string>
        <string _locid="40498">You may have outscored me the last time we met but I will be the dominant player in this match.</string>
        <string _locid="40499">Ah my little upstart, finally came to your senses and joined my side eh?</string>
        <string _locid="40500">The last time we met your score was pretty low. I hope you've improved since then.</string>
        <string _locid="40501">I see you prefer the play style this map offers which is good since I do as well.</string>
        <string _locid="40502">Heed my advice this time my little upstart and we should fare much better.</string>
        <string _locid="40503">Let us make sure our fate in this match is the same as the last one.</string>
        <string _locid="40504">Well I paid the ransom for my explorer, let's hope he stays alive a little longer this time around.</string>
        <string _locid="40505">My explorer must be a spy! He keeps dying in enemy territory forcing me to pay the enemy a hefty ransom to get him back each time.</string>
        <string _locid="40506">This explorer just makes me poor and my enemies richer with each ransom.</string>
        <string _locid="40507">Ha! I was able to rescue my explorer without paying his ransom.</string>
        <string _locid="40508">I've rescued my explorer. Let's see how long he lives.</string>
        <string _locid="40509">Well, it seems our enemy is too poor to maintain an army to defend his town. We should take advantage and strike!</string>
        <string _locid="40510">My scouts tell me the enemy has no barracks in his town, cavalry should ride through it unimpeded.</string>
        <string _locid="40511">Bring the big guns! Our artillery should be safe attacking the enemy's town since he has no Stable.</string>
        <string _locid="40512">A wealthy nation is a strong nation, so here is some coin.</string>
        <string _locid="40513">I assume you will use this food wisely.</string>
        <string _locid="40514">I have all the wood I need right now, I'm sending some of my extra logs.</string>
        <string _locid="40515">The enemy base here makes some of my settlers nervous so I'm going to destroy it.</string>
        <string _locid="40516">My forces are on the move to the enemy base, I shall be declaring a glorious victory in the near future.</string>
        <string _locid="40517">The enemy settlers are making him rich. I plan going to send a small force to take some out.</string>
        <string _locid="40518">You have to hit the heart to kill the beast. I march on the enemy's main town.</string>
        <string _locid="40519">Watch me take the enemy's main town my little upstart. You might learn something.</string>
        <string _locid="40520">The alliance to these natives is a boost to the enemy's forces I can no longer allow him to have.</string>
        <string _locid="40521">This trade post might make the enemy wealthier than me, I must destroy it.</string>
        <string _locid="40522">I see you're in a fight! My troops are on the way.</string>
        <string _locid="40523">Looks like you're doing well over there, but I'm sending my forces in to make sure it stays that way.</string>
        <string _locid="40524">Rest easy my little upstart, my forces are en route to make sure the outcome there is in our favor.</string>
        <string _locid="40525">This will be the location of my next military base.</string>
        <string _locid="40526">My new town will be built in this location.</string>
        <string _locid="40527">I shall form an alliance with these natives to bolster our forces.</string>
        <string _locid="40528">I believe these natives will be very helpful in the future.</string>
        <string _locid="40529">We Dutch are amazing traders, it only makes sense I build a trade post.</string>
        <string _locid="40530">Once I finish this trade post my wealth will grow immensely.</string>
        <string _locid="40531">This building shall not fall!</string>
        <string _locid="40532">This area has too much value, I will not let the enemy take it.</string>
        <string _locid="40533">I can not allow the enemy to break our alliance with those natives, my forces will protect that area.</string>
        <string _locid="40534">My forces will protect this town.</string>
        <string _locid="40535">I will not let the enemy take this trade post.</string>
        <string _locid="40536">Feel good knowing that Dutch coin will continue to flow into your coffers.</string>
        <string _locid="40537">Your people should never go hungry with this food I'm sending you.</string>
        <string _locid="40538">I suspect I'll see a whole new colony soon from the wood I'm sending you.</string>
        <string _locid="40539">Hold on! My troops are on the way.</string>
        <string _locid="40540">I see you're having trouble defending yourself my little upstart. Don't worry my forces are en route.</string>
        <string _locid="40541">I'm ready to send troops there to help turn back the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40542">It's been quiet, maybe too quiet.</string>
        <string _locid="40543">Hope all is well over there, all is fine here.</string>
        <string _locid="40544">Did you know my father was called "the Silent"?</string>
        <string _locid="40545">Could you spare some coin? Just this once I promise.</string>
        <string _locid="40546">My people are hungry, do you have some food to spare?</string>
        <string _locid="40547">I need to build a bank or something, could I have some wood?</string>
        <string _locid="40548">I knew the enemy was lost once your forces showed up.</string>
        <string _locid="40549">Our combined forces on the battlefield, is there a better duo?</string>
        <string _locid="40550">Thank you my little upstart, your troops, although not needed, were welcomed for joining my forces in that battle.</string>
        <string _locid="40551">I shall put this coin to good use.</string>
        <string _locid="40552">Your generosity is greatly appreciated.</string>
        <string _locid="40553">My base survives because of you, thank you.</string>
        <string _locid="40554">The goods you sent me will not go to waste.</string>
        <string _locid="40555">This wood will build many great structures in my town.</string>
        <string _locid="40556">Our outcome looks bleak when looking at the strength of the British player.</string>
        <string _locid="40557">If anyone could put us between a rock and  a hard place I should have known it would be the Dutch.</string>
        <string _locid="40558">The French ride all over us as yet we can not stop them.</string>
        <string _locid="40559">The Ottomans are mighty. They will surely be the cause of our demise.</string>
        <string _locid="40560">(Sighs) When did the Portuguese become so tough?</string>
        <string _locid="40561">Seems the Russians are as many and as strong here in the New World as they are back home.</string>
        <string _locid="40562">The Spanish are everywhere. I do not know if we can defeat them.</string>
        <string _locid="40563">All is not lost. The British are barely holding on.</string>
        <string _locid="40564">The situation is not in our favor but the Dutch are conformable.</string>
        <string _locid="40565">We need to turn the tide of this contest but I sense the French are no real threat to us.</string>
        <string _locid="40566">It seems the Germans are lost and sputtering out of control.. Through them we might be able to change our future. </string>
        <string _locid="40567">The enemy seems too strong but I think the Portuguese are their weak link.</string>
        <string _locid="40568">We may be behind right now but the Russians shouldn't last much longer.</string>
        <string _locid="40569">We're not doing so well but the Spanish are doing even worse.</string>
        <string _locid="40570">Please forgive me, I fear I will be the cause of our great alliance not prospering as it should.</string>
        <string _locid="40571">You are the pinnacle of our strength my little upstart. But I'm not sure you'll be enough to get us out of this one.</string>
        <string _locid="40572">Looks like the end is near, I do not think my strength is enough to hold for the both of us.</string>
        <string _locid="40573">I will have to train you to be more my equal so that we may crush our enemies instead of them crushing us.</string>
        <string _locid="40574">Our combined strength is unmatched.</string>
        <string _locid="40575">It seems you're keeping up with me quite well my little upstart. The enemy no longer has the strength to stand up to our power.</string>
        <string _locid="40576">This alliance has brought me great prosperity. You're better than I imagined you could be.</string>
        <string _locid="40577">Looks like I will ride to glory again, on your coattails of course.</string>
        <string _locid="40578">It's okay your nation isn't as strong as mine, I'll take us both to victory.</string>
        <string _locid="40579">Don't worry my little upstart, I'm doing well enough for the both of us.</string>
        <string _locid="40580">This battle is lost, if we resign now perhaps we can fight together another day.</string>
        <string _locid="40581">We fought the good fight but we've been beaten.</string>
        <string _locid="40582">All is lost, let us resign and take them on again.</string>
        <string _locid="40583">We've missed our chance at victory. Let us resign and fight again.</string>
        <string _locid="40584">They have forged the first alliance with the natives here but it will be their last.</string>
        <string _locid="40585">The enemy is looking to increase their wealth by building on a trade site.</string>
        <string _locid="40586">They are forging more native alliances. We might see more native warrior on the field they we can handle.</string>
        <string _locid="40587">They've built another trade post, they must be stopped.</string>
        <string _locid="40588">Good move, your natives will surely help crush our enemies.</string>
        <string _locid="40589">I'm sure the enemy is quite jealous of your new trade post.</string>
        <string _locid="40590">Nice work! That treasure should be helpful.</string>
        <string _locid="40591">Resources and units from treasures are always A nice bonus.</string>
        <string _locid="40592">Extra coin to your coffers. Spend it wisely.</string>
        <string _locid="40593">You should use that food to build more settlers and expand your economy.</string>
        <string _locid="40594">You must be a skillful leader to take such advantage of the treasures around you.</string>
        <string _locid="40595">As long as you put that treasure to good use I won't mind you taking it from my lands.</string>
        <string _locid="40596">Native warriors, a welcome addition to any army.</string>
        <string _locid="40597">Extra settlers should really help to get your economy going.</string>
        <string _locid="40598">Extra wood is never a bad thing to have.</string>
        <string _locid="40599">Having the upper hand with the natives in this region definitely favors our side.</string>
        <string _locid="40600">Having more trade sites helps create a wealthier nation and I believe a wealthy nation is a strong nation.</string>
        <string _locid="40601">Wall defenses should hold the enemy back for a time.</string>
        <string _locid="40602">Are you getting scared my little upstart? Don't fret, my forces will protect you as well.</string>
        <string _locid="40603">It seems our enemy underestimates the power of these natives, but I do not.</string>
        <string _locid="40604">Like a good businessman a leader must look for ways to improve his wealth and that's what this trade post will do for me.</string>
        <string _locid="40605">What's this? My explorer has done something useful. Haha!</string>
        <string _locid="40606">I will use this treasure to strengthen both our nations.</string>
        <string _locid="40607">These treasures are very useful. Do you see some more?</string>
        <string _locid="40608">The rich just keep getting richer.</string>
        <string _locid="40609">This extra food will help feed my nation.</string>
        <string _locid="40610">I have been eyeing this treasure for some time now. Since you didn't take it, I did.</string>
        <string _locid="40611">You should try to find some more treasures. They're really a boost to any nation.</string>
        <string _locid="40612">If you wish to be powerful and wealthy like me, you need to find more treasures my little upstart.</string>
        <string _locid="40613">I shall use this Native warrior to scout and destroy our enemies.</string>
        <string _locid="40614">Maybe I'll use this wood for a market or bank.</string>
        <string _locid="40615">I couldn't let those tyrants have more native alliances in this region than us.</string>
        <string _locid="40616">More trade sites means more wealth, and you know I like being wealthy.</string>
        <string _locid="40617">The enemy forces are making me nervous so I'm putting up some walls so they cannot surprise me.</string>
        <string _locid="40618">Four of a kind! Lets research the victory condition and put an end to this war.</string>
        <string _locid="40619">Are you an imposter? Because your skill rating was much higher the last time we played.</string>
        <string _locid="40620">I see you've been practicing my little upstart. Your skill rating is much higher than I last remember it.</string>
        <string _locid="40621">I see you've gained quite a bit of experience since we played last. I hope your Home City is more powerful to show for it.</string>
        <string _locid="40622">You might defeat me this time but know it won't be easy to do again.</string>
        <string _locid="40623">Only 1 minute until the end. Can you feel the pressure?</string>
        <string _locid="40624">What a glorious fight, many heroes will be born today.</string>
        <string _locid="40625">You should turn and run, this battle does not look good for you.</string>
        <string _locid="40626">Are those the only troops your nation could afford?</string>
        <string _locid="40627">I'm telling you this as an enemy that respects you, you should retreat.</string>
        <string _locid="40628">My ally has come to save me, don't you wish you ran while you had the chance?</string>
        <string _locid="40629">I see you could not face me alone. Obviously begging your ally for assistance.</string>
        <string _locid="40630">Your technological advances will not save you from the wrath of my forces.</string>
        <string _locid="40631">How did you manage to Age up so quickly? You must tell me your secret.</string>
        <string _locid="40632">Those natives will not be enough to stop my forces.</string>
        <string _locid="40633">You have saved yourself the wrath of many native warriors by destroying that trade post.</string>
        <string _locid="40634">My town center is lost but I am not.</string>
        <string _locid="40635">Drat! That trade post was bringing me much wealth.</string>
        <string _locid="40636">Please advance the Age, I don't want to destroy another nation of barbarians.</string>
        <string _locid="40637">Are you aware of my technological advances? Perhaps you should try to catch up.</string>
        <string _locid="40638">Rushing up Age will not guarantee you victory in the end.</string>
        <string _locid="40639">A little slow on your Age advancement I see. Perhaps you need a minute before I attack?</string>
        <string _locid="40640">Your town center is far from your ally. After I destroy this one I'm sure you'll build your next one a lot closer to him.</string>
        <string _locid="40641">Building next to your ally is the best decision you've made all game, my little upstart.</string>
        <string _locid="40642">Did you think I would allow you to win in such a manner?</string>
        <string _locid="40643">Your native alliance was making you too powerful so I ended it for you.</string>
        <string _locid="40644">Your town center is lost. You will be as well if you do not make the smart decision and resign now.</string>
        <string _locid="40645">I know the wealth a trade post can provide, therefore I couldn't allow you to keep yours much longer.</string>
        <string _locid="40646">A fine day for a war is it not?</string>
        <string _locid="40647">If you consider resigning now I might give you 200 gold for your troubles.</string>
        <string _locid="40648">No formal 'hellos' now, I'll make your acquaintance later on the battlefield.</string>
        <string _locid="40649">I respect you challenging yourself by raising the skill level, but I fear the result may not be what you had hoped.</string>
        <string _locid="40650">Playing at a lower skill level this time. Probably a smart choice when facing me.</string>
        <string _locid="40651">I think you feel this map type helps your play, but realize it also helps mine.</string>
        <string _locid="40652">It was wise of you to lessen the odds against you but I do not think you lowered them enough.</string>
        <string _locid="40653">You could not stop me from rescuing my explorer and I can not stop him from destroying your town.</string>
        <string _locid="40654">My explorer is up but don't worry he's not much of a threat.</string>
        <string _locid="40655">I see your forces with an explorer keeping an eye for them. Well done.</string>
        <string _locid="40656">I just wanted you to know that force your explorer is leading round does not scare me.</string>
        <string _locid="40657">I'm warning you now, if those troops with your explorer come any closer to my town I'm going to have to take him out.</string>
        <string _locid="40658">I see some of your units. They look lost. Where is your explorer?</string>
        <string _locid="40659">Those troops look like an easy target for my men to train their skill.</string>
        <string _locid="40660">For the safety of your own men you should keep them in your town and away from my forces.</string>
        <string _locid="40661">It would be unwise of you to attack me with those forces near my base.</string>
        <string _locid="40662">Only the weak prey on defenseless settlers.</string>
        <string _locid="40663">You obviously need to attack settlers because my troops would cut yours to pieces.</string>
        <string _locid="40664">My losses will be dwarfed compared to what I'm about to do to you!</string>
        <string _locid="40665">Wow! That's an impressive force I see.</string>
        <string _locid="40666">Your force is of decent size but I would advise not attacking with it.</string>
        <string _locid="40667">This will not bode well for me.</string>
        <string _locid="40668">Is that what you call a raid??</string>
        <string _locid="40669">I have found your town. Now I know where to strike.</string>
        <string _locid="40670">I have spotted your town and for now, it actually resembles mine in some ways.</string>
        <string _locid="40671">Well my little upstart, if you want that town of yours to survive you should surrender it to me now.</string>
        <string _locid="40672">Its unfortunate that you could not get this treasure because it sure was helpful.</string>
        <string _locid="40673">Ha! My army is on your doorstep!</string>
        <string _locid="40674">I am here and prepared to fight!</string>
        <string _locid="40675">It is time to test your skills my little upstart, my army is upon you!</string>
        <string _locid="40676">I so enjoy having time to build upon my economy.</string>
        <string _locid="40677">I hope you're using this time wisely, my next attack is not too far away.</string>
        <string _locid="40678">What do you do with your nation when I'm not attacking you?</string>
        <string _locid="40679">You have beaten me, and I would like to offer my surrender.</string>
        <string _locid="40680">I sense I can no longer obtain victory, may I resign now?</string>
        <string _locid="40682">Your actions have only delayed the inevitable.</string>
        <string _locid="40683">Nicely done, alliances with natives may be the path to victory in this conflict.</string>
        <string _locid="40684">That trade post will not help you gain more wealth than my banks can produce.</string>
        <string _locid="40686">That is only one treasure, I will find many more than that.</string>
        <string _locid="40687">Do you have the wisdom to use that treasure wisely?</string>
        <string _locid="40688">It is better you got that treasure or I would have too great an advantage over you.</string>
        <string _locid="40689">Hmm, seems your explorer finds useful things to do with his time, unlike mine.</string>
        <string _locid="40690">Will you be able to buy an army to beat me with that little bit of coin?</string>
        <string _locid="40691">A little bit of food, I'm not worried.</string>
        <string _locid="40692">You have an unfair advantage, your explorer is doing something useful.</string>
        <string _locid="40693">I left that treasure there as a trap, now I'm going to hunt your explorer down.</string>
        <string _locid="40694">Natives are good but treasure will not be enough to help you in the end.</string>
        <string _locid="40695">I'm sure I could put those settler to better use in my town.</string>
        <string _locid="40696">That will just give me more building to tear down.</string>
        <string _locid="40697">A wise plan to wall in, but they won't be enough to save you.</string>
        <string _locid="40698">I thought you were not afraid of me when we declared war on each other but these walls make me think differently.</string>
        <string _locid="40699">Be careful, soon native warriors will be attacking your town.</string>
        <string _locid="40700">This trade post will only add to my wealth.</string>
        <string _locid="40701">My explorer must really want to destroy you because he is actually helping to victory.</string>
        <string _locid="40702">I'm sorry but I could not allow you to have this treasure.</string>
        <string _locid="40703">More coin to my coffers!!</string>
        <string _locid="40704">This will help me field an army greater than yours.</string>
        <string _locid="40705">Why do you leave such treasures for me on your lands? I guess you know those lands will belong to me soon enough.</string>
        <string _locid="40706">Is your explorer dead? I haven't seen him.</string>
        <string _locid="40707">You'll see him soon ... attacking your town.</string>
        <string _locid="40708">Extra settlers for a wealthy nation, this cannot fare well for you.</string>
        <string _locid="40709">This wood will help me build a barracks or a bank, whichever.</string>
        <string _locid="40710">That alliance won't last long.</string>
        <string _locid="40711">That trade site will help you become almost as wealthy as me.</string>
        <string _locid="40712">Trying to take the easy win condition, eh my little upstart? I'll put an end to this nonsense.</string>
        <string _locid="40713">Take the peaceful way defeat and just allow this timer to run out.</string>
        <string _locid="40714">What happened to your rating? Been facing more leaders like myself?</string>
        <string _locid="40715">I see your rating is going up, are you ready for your next lesson my little upstart?</string>
        <string _locid="40716">I hope all that experience has made your Home City more powerful than the last time we met.</string>
        <string _locid="40718">The enemy will no longer benefit from this native alliance. I am going to destroy their base here. </string>
        <string _locid="40719">I shall comply immediately.</string>
        <string _locid="40720">Well thought out!</string>
        <string _locid="40721">I regret that I am not allowed to take that step.</string>
        <string _locid="40722">It is impossible for me to do as you wish.</string>
        <string _locid="40723">Yes I agree. Artillery backed by cavalry it is.</string>
        <string _locid="40724">You are right. Artillery plus infantry should seal our enemy's fate.</string>
        <string _locid="40725">Artillery is the god of the battlefield, after all.</string>
        <string _locid="40726">The best generals were all artillerymen first.</string>
        <string _locid="40727">My cavalry can run amuck! With some artillery pieces to back them up we shall have a fine army.</string>
        <string _locid="40728">Yes, if I train cavalry - perhaps even cuirassiers - and accompany them with some infantry ... we shall see ...</string>
        <string _locid="40729">The enemy's control of these natives has been a pain like a boil. I am about to lance it.</string>
        <string _locid="40730">I love infantry. Their stolid relentless nature brings out the best in my artillerymen as well. </string>
        <string _locid="40731">I shall train infantry! The queen of battle! With some horsemen to keep their flanks safe.</string>
        <string _locid="40732">I will train the cavalry component of our joint army.</string>
        <string _locid="40733">I see you have heard the reputation of the French cavalry! Soon they shall fight at your side.</string>
        <string _locid="40734">Infantry has many uses. I shall train as large a force as possible. </string>
        <string _locid="40735">Infantry have staying power that other units lack. I shall field as many as you need.</string>
        <string _locid="40736">Now you have the economic edge over our foe.</string>
        <string _locid="40737">Use the gold wisely.</string>
        <string _locid="40738">An army travels on its stomach. It is good you found food.</string>
        <string _locid="40739">What a creative way to add to your army.</string>
        <string _locid="40740">I am going to deny the enemy this trading site.</string>
        <string _locid="40741">We need wood as much as steel and shot.</string>
        <string _locid="40742">I will take all of these I can get.</string>
        <string _locid="40743">I can use this coin to pay my soldiers.</string>
        <string _locid="40744">Food to feed my soldiers!</string>
        <string _locid="40745">Free soldiers are always good for the soul.</string>
        <string _locid="40746">More wood - more buildings.</string>
        <string _locid="40747">I never doubted my eventual victory in that fight.</string>
        <string _locid="40748">The enemy soldiers gave it their best shot, but it was not enough.</string>
        <string _locid="40749">Did you watch that fight closely? You can learn something from my skill as a commander.</string>
        <string _locid="40750">All too easy.</string>
        <string _locid="40751">No more trade for the enemy here!</string>
        <string _locid="40752">I thought I would win. And I did.</string>
        <string _locid="40753">I wish the enemy would present more of a challenge.</string>
        <string _locid="40754">The best offense is a good defense.</string>
        <string _locid="40755">Walling in my main base will free up more troops for the attack.</string>
        <string _locid="40756">Keep calm. All we have to do is knock out one of the enemy posts and all will be well.</string>
        <string _locid="40757">We need to organize for an assault on one of the four enemy posts as soon as possible.</string>
        <string _locid="40758">We have them by the nape of the neck. If they cannot break through our defenses, they are done for.</string>
        <string _locid="40759">Do not relax your vigilance. The enemy will be desperate now.</string>
        <string _locid="40760">Congratulations are in order, I see. Your multiplayer rating has skyrocketed since we last met.</string>
        <string _locid="40761">How impressive - your multiplayer score is much higher than before.</string>
        <string _locid="40762">This is the most strategic place for me to set up a new base.</string>
        <string _locid="40763">I see your multiplayer score has dropped since our last session. Well, watch what I do and learn.</string>
        <string _locid="40764">Your multiplayer rating is so low! I will try to teach you what I can, but it's up to you to apply it in battle.</string>
        <string _locid="40765">I am happy to see that you have been building your skills and experience since we last met.</string>
        <string _locid="40766">I applaud you for increasing your Home City's size so much since last time.</string>
        <string _locid="40767">Something about this map seems familiar to me.</string>
        <string _locid="40768">Our last fight alongside one another was a bit of a fiasco. I'm sure we will turn it around this time.</string>
        <string _locid="40769">Remember what you did last time we played? We lost. So don't do that same stuff.</string>
        <string _locid="40770">Remember what you did the last time we played? We won. So do the same things!</string>
        <string _locid="40771">I promise to do better than last time.</string>
        <string _locid="40772">Try to improve on your past skills, please.</string>
        <string _locid="40773">The enemy will not like the base I'm going to construct here.</string>
        <string _locid="40774">I went easy on you when we fought each other last time. Now that we are allies, I'm pulling out all the stops.</string>
        <string _locid="40775">So now you seek me as an ally instead of a foeman. That is wise.</string>
        <string _locid="40776">This is quite irksome. I guess we will have to seek victory the old-fashioned way.</string>
        <string _locid="40777">Even though the enemy has already allied with the natives, we still have a little time before he can make that alliance effective. We must move quickly and decisively.</string>
        <string _locid="40778">The enemy now has natives, unlike us. We can only hope that this alliance has overstretched them.</string>
        <string _locid="40779">The enemy now has a trading post. I trust this means they will be emphasizing their shopkeepers instead of their military.</string>
        <string _locid="40780">The enemy may have overstretched their resources, building that trading post so soon.</string>
        <string _locid="40781">Though the enemy has more native villages on his side, we should be able to keep up with his numbers by diligently training our troops. </string>
        <string _locid="40782">Why is our enemy building so many trading posts? What are they thinking?</string>
        <string _locid="40783">With these extra natives, we can outfight and outtrain our enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40784">Here is my next town center.</string>
        <string _locid="40785">More trading posts means more money, which can be turned into a bigger army.</string>
        <string _locid="40786">We have natives now. And the enemy does not!</string>
        <string _locid="40787">I am glad to see you are keeping an eye on the trading post sites.</string>
        <string _locid="40788">Well, I have stopped their victory countdown. Now they will probably resort to other means.</string>
        <string _locid="40789">As expected, I have claimed the first native village.</string>
        <string _locid="40790">It is only logical that I should claim a trade route first.</string>
        <string _locid="40792">Every trading post we build brings us closer to economic triumph.</string>
        <string _locid="40793">I do not fear the outcome of this fight. Even at a higher difficulty level than our last combat, we should win.</string>
        <string _locid="40794">We do not have much of a challenge ahead of us, now that you've turned down the difficulty.</string>
        <string _locid="40795">Now I shall annex this land here.</string>
        <string _locid="40796">There is no time to waste! Throw everything you have at the enemy trading posts or we are done for! </string>
        <string _locid="40797">Victory is all but assured now. They have but one minute to stop us, and I do not think they can do it.</string>
        <string _locid="40798">A single minute. Then the laurels of victory will be ours.</string>
        <string _locid="40799">There is no hope for us now, my friend. I have let you down. Let us surrender while we still have a little dignity.</string>
        <string _locid="40800">These natives will no longer serve the purposes of our enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40801">That is the end of that town. Let us move on to the next.</string>
        <string _locid="40802">He no longer has the use of that town. It is in our hands. </string>
        <string _locid="40803">Now that we have captured this area, should we build our own trading site here?</string>
        <string _locid="40804">That base was too well-fortified. We will need a stronger army.</string>
        <string _locid="40805">That village was surprisingly difficult to take down.</string>
        <string _locid="40806">This area is rich in resources and tactically vital. I will take it.</string>
        <string _locid="40807">His town has foiled us. For now. </string>
        <string _locid="40808">We must try harder in the future. That trading post further strengthens our opponent every minute.</string>
        <string _locid="40809">Why do you fight on? The case is hopeless. If you do not surrender soon, I may do so on my own.</string>
        <string _locid="40810">Coin - your war chest can use this, can it not?</string>
        <string _locid="40811">The French have the finest cuisine in the world my friend. Take these rations and see for yourself.</string>
        <string _locid="40812">Wood may not be as exciting as coin or food, but it is still necessary. Take this for your coffers.</string>
        <string _locid="40813">I cannot do as you request.</string>
        <string _locid="40814">The critical place we must help is this spot, here.</string>
        <string _locid="40815">I need your assistance - kindly send troops to this point as soon as possible.</string>
        <string _locid="40816">My soldiers are already en route.</string>
        <string _locid="40817">The natives here are going to assist us.</string>
        <string _locid="40818">I am going to reinforce you here.</string>
        <string _locid="40819">In my opinion we need more men here. I am sending them right now.</string>
        <string _locid="40820">I will be there as soon as possible.</string>
        <string _locid="40821">You will not lose here. I have sent a corps to back you up.</string>
        <string _locid="40822">Keep it up. Soon my men will arrive and the jaws of the trap will close on the enemy army.</string>
        <string _locid="40823">I have assigned a sufficient force to defend this building.</string>
        <string _locid="40824">None shall pass.</string>
        <string _locid="40825">I will keep this native village out of the enemy's hands.</string>
        <string _locid="40826">The enemy should not take this town. I will guard it.</string>
        <string _locid="40827">This would be a dangerous spot for the enemy to build on. I will protect it.</string>
        <string _locid="40828">What?! How can this be? I can't fight on without troops or resources! I tender my resignation to you. </string>
        <string _locid="40829">I have fought the natives before, and they were redoubtable enemies. They will be equally redoubtable friends.</string>
        <string _locid="40830">Tell me when you no longer need the extra coin, and I will stop sending it.</string>
        <string _locid="40831">Ah, food cooked by French chefs. Tell me when you need no more.</string>
        <string _locid="40832">Let me know when I have sent enough wood to you.</string>
        <string _locid="40833">I am pleased to have an ally worthy of my prowess.</string>
        <string _locid="40834">I need some coin right now. I vow it will go to good use.</string>
        <string _locid="40835">Please send me some coin if at all possible.</string>
        <string _locid="40836">I need food badly.</string>
        <string _locid="40837">An army travels on its stomach. Can you ship me some food?</string>
        <string _locid="40838">Without wood, how can I build an empire? Do you have some wood you're not using?</string>
        <string _locid="40839">Ship me some wood. Now. Er ... please?</string>
        <string _locid="40840">I will form a French/Indian alliance.</string>
        <string _locid="40841">They are doomed. Already I can taste victory.</string>
        <string _locid="40842">Their soldiers are too few, and too badly managed. I sense victory.</string>
        <string _locid="40843">See how the enemy line is already beginning to crack under my troops' hammerblows.</string>
        <string _locid="40844">I could have done it without your assistance, but you did save me some time.</string>
        <string _locid="40845">Working together we were able to save my base.</string>
        <string _locid="40846">Perhaps I could have saved my base alone. We shall never know.</string>
        <string _locid="40847">A few more victories like this, and our foe will be undone.</string>
        <string _locid="40848">This is just the way I won the battle of Austerlitz.</string>
        <string _locid="40849">Let us take a brief breather, and return to the fray once more.</string>
        <string _locid="40850">This coin will be put to good use.</string>
        <string _locid="40851">A trading post can be as strong a weapon as a fortress.</string>
        <string _locid="40852">This is just what I needed.</string>
        <string _locid="40853">This food is almost as good as my own chefs could cook.</string>
        <string _locid="40854">This wood comes at a most opportune time.</string>
        <string _locid="40855">You must be able to recognize a defeat well ahead of time, so that you can keep it as minimal as possible.</string>
        <string _locid="40856">Pull back at once! The enemy is too strong here.</string>
        <string _locid="40858">With artillery, war is made. You have a lack of these basic means, my ally.</string>
        <string _locid="40859">Cavalry is the answer to our problems. Equip some horsemen and we can ride down the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="40860">Your army is unbalanced. You need more horsemen to balance the rest of your forces.</string>
        <string _locid="40861">Infantry is the queen of battle. You have too many kings and not enough queens.</string>
        <string _locid="40862">Trade brings wealth, and wealth: power.</string>
        <string _locid="40863">Infantry is the backbone of any army. Your army, my friend, is practically spineless by comparison.</string>
        <string _locid="40864">The situation does not look good, my friend. Perhaps we should make a dignified retreat and resign this game.</string>
        <string _locid="40865">This time they have proven the stronger force. Perhaps we will defeat them next time. Shall we resign now?</string>
        <string _locid="40866">A soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon.</string>
        <string _locid="40867">You know - a throne is only a bench covered with velvet.</string>
        <string _locid="40868">Death is nothing - to live defeated is to die daily.</string>
        <string _locid="40869">Attack! Down with you, vile enemy!</string>
        <string _locid="40870">Now you should begin to understand just how badly you have blundered.</string>
        <string _locid="40871">Your men are doomed.</string>
        <string _locid="40872">Can't you train your own?</string>
        <string _locid="40873">I need money to expand my economy. Trade will do the trick.</string>
        <string _locid="40874">Hard up for gold?</string>
        <string _locid="40875">Are your folks starving, that you would waste time looting that?</string>
        <string _locid="40876">Can't train your own soldiers, so you recruit them from the wilderness?</string>
        <string _locid="40877">Wood is in the trees, not laying around the ground.</string>
        <string _locid="40878">More settlers means a bigger economy which means a stronger army. Too bad for you.</string>
        <string _locid="40879">Wealth is the blood of nations.</string>
        <string _locid="40880">More rations for my ever-growing forces.</string>
        <string _locid="40881">More warriors for my army! And free ones at that!</string>
        <string _locid="40882">Wood is good for natives, artillery, and necessary buildings. Free wood is best.</string>
        <string _locid="40883">Can't you put up a better fight?</string>
        <string _locid="40884">I go now to raid their settlers.</string>
        <string _locid="40885">That battle was rather ... trivial. I kept hoping you had an interesting surprise up your sleeve. But no.</string>
        <string _locid="40886">Is that it? I guess it was too much to expect you to pull off a win with those odds against you.</string>
        <string _locid="40887">This war might be more interesting than I had predicted. </string>
        <string _locid="40888">Nice job. I'll have to change my strategy I see.</string>
        <string _locid="40889">Your multiplayer rating is much higher. I hope this means you will present an interesting challenge for me.</string>
        <string _locid="40890">I see your multiplayer rating has plummeted since our last encounter. Well, watch carefully what I do and perhaps you'll learn something.</string>
        <string _locid="40891">I've been idle for so long. Thanks for letting me have another chance to meet you.</string>
        <string _locid="40892">Are you in a rut? This is the same kind of countryside as the last time we played!</string>
        <string _locid="40893">This is going to be harder for me than the last time we met.</string>
        <string _locid="40894">I respect an opponent who's willing to take on a tougher challenge than he did last game. My hat is off to you.</string>
        <string _locid="40895">I am going to kill off some enemy settlers to slow their economy's growth.</string>
        <string _locid="40896">Cunning of you to use map control and four trading posts to try for a victory. It won't work, however.</string>
        <string _locid="40897">You may have access to more native warriors for now, but soon the situation will be altered in my favor.</string>
        <string _locid="40898">Now that my explorer has been rescued, his labors will benefit us both.</string>
        <string _locid="40899">You have spread yourself thin on the trade routes. I can take keen advantage of this.</string>
        <string _locid="40900">The problem: too many enemy trading posts. The solution: elimination. Problem solved.</string>
        <string _locid="40901">The natives don't want your burdensome rule. They'll be much better off under MY burdensome rule.</string>
        <string _locid="40902">This is a decisive blow at your very heart!</string>
        <string _locid="40903">This time your trading post - next time your whole empire!</string>
        <string _locid="40904">With these native warriors assisting me, I can swamp you with numbers.</string>
        <string _locid="40905">You are remiss, my friend. This trading post will boost my power and lead to my ultimate win.</string>
        <string _locid="40906">I suppose those walls might delay the inevitable for a few short minutes.</string>
        <string _locid="40907">The money you're wasting on those walls would have been better used to beef up your army.</string>
        <string _locid="40908">Excellent! You have saved us from the cost of a ransom.</string>
        <string _locid="40909">I had marked those natives as MY allies. I must do something about the situation.</string>
        <string _locid="40910">I think by building that trading post, you have stretched your resources just a little too far.</string>
        <string _locid="40911">I did not need that particular native alliance anyway.</string>
        <string _locid="40912">It is most annoying, but I can survive without that trading post. For now.</string>
        <string _locid="40913">You think this will stop me? It just steels my resolve.</string>
        <string _locid="40914">Don't think this ends the threat to you.</string>
        <string _locid="40915">Of course I always fight to the best of my ability. But now that you have increased the difficulty, my ability has risen accordingly. Beware!</string>
        <string _locid="40916">Couldn't take the higher difficulties, eh? Decided to turn it down a notch?</string>
        <string _locid="40917">Now the burden for action is on your shoulders. All I have to do is keep a firm grip on my trading posts and it's all over.</string>
        <string _locid="40918">Just one minute ... wait! Surely you don't want it to end this way? Demolish one of your trading posts, quick! Let us end this with a bang, not a whimper.</string>
        <string _locid="40919">Aha! Thanks to you, my explorer is back in action. </string>
        <string _locid="40920">You fools. You thought you could defeat me. Now I am only seconds from winning.</string>
        <string _locid="40921">Even over something as trivial as that treasure, I am able to give your soldiers a sound drubbing.</string>
        <string _locid="40922">You'll need more soldiers than that to attack MY town.</string>
        <string _locid="40923">Your troops are out in the open. Exposed. </string>
        <string _locid="40924">Now that I can see where your explorer is headed, I know your entire plan.</string>
        <string _locid="40925">You stand no chance against my skilled legions. Surrender now.</string>
        <string _locid="40926">This fight is going to be complicated. That will give me a natural advantage.</string>
        <string _locid="40927">Sometimes it is good to look to our defenses, such as walls.</string>
        <string _locid="40928">I see you have walled off your base. I considered it myself.</string>
        <string _locid="40929">Ha ha! Perfidious Albion will soon be no more! </string>
        <string _locid="40930">I'm sure I'd be able to conquer you if we only fought a little longer. But in the interest of saving time I hereby offer to quit in your favor. Is that acceptable?</string>
        <string _locid="40931">Alas! I need my explorer and we could not rescue him, so I paid a hefty ransom. At least he is back now. </string>
        <string _locid="40932">Those cursed Beefeaters are proving difficult for our troops to overcome. Will it be another Waterloo?</string>
        <string _locid="40933">I never did think the Dutch would offer much of a threat.</string>
        <string _locid="40934">The wealth and power of the Dutch are giving them disproportionate strength.</string>
        <string _locid="40935">Tres bien! We now know who is best suited to rule the French nation! </string>
        <string _locid="40936">The enemy French are nearly as strong as mine. This could be a problem, my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="40937">Germany was my battlefield and playground for many a year. History repeats itself.</string>
        <string _locid="40938">These Germans seem strangely effective in combat. Too effective.</string>
        <string _locid="40939">One Turk can beat three Frenchmen. But ten Frenchmen are a match for ten Turks. And one hundred Frenchmen can defeat any number of Turks.</string>
        <string _locid="40940">The Ottomans have always been a powerful enemy. One-for-one they may be the strongest soldiers in Europe!</string>
        <string _locid="40941">So much for the vaunted Portuguese. I had wondered what they would be like to fight. Mere pushovers.</string>
        <string _locid="40942">I had to pay through the nose to get my explorer back. If only we could have rescued him.</string>
        <string _locid="40943">The Portuguese are proving stalwart opponents. There must be something we can do about them. </string>
        <string _locid="40944">The Russians are almost gone. I wish I had you by my side when I marched on Moscow in 1812, my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="40945">The Russians are proving as stubborn here in the New World as they did in the Old.</string>
        <string _locid="40946">The Spanish never could stand up to good French firepower.</string>
        <string _locid="40947">Spain proved an annoying problem to me in 1807-1814. History seems to be repeating itself.</string>
        <string _locid="40948">The enemy is too strong for me at this time. Please send help at once.</string>
        <string _locid="40949">They have somehow overcome my forces. My weakness may now prove your Achilles heel.</string>
        <string _locid="40950">I fear I have met another Waterloo at the hands of the hated British.</string>
        <string _locid="40951">The enemy has us on the defensive. Perhaps we can at least destroy the perfidious British?</string>
        <string _locid="40952">I wish the Dutch had been on our side, instead of opposed to us.</string>
        <string _locid="40953">Bravo! My men have rescued my explorer. </string>
        <string _locid="40954">My advice is for us to try to take out the Dutch player. Annihilate him, and we could turn this war around.</string>
        <string _locid="40955">The French are, as always, redoubtable. In fact, I think they have beaten me soundly.</string>
        <string _locid="40956">I no longer have confidence in our ultimate victory. But for now, the enemy French are vulnerable to a counterattack.</string>
        <string _locid="40957">I do not like our prospects. But I think the Germans are the enemy's weak point.</string>
        <string _locid="40958">You have betrayed our cause. I would have won if you had not dragged me down with your floundering! </string>
        <string _locid="40959">So your ineptitude has brought me to this pass. Now it looks as though we might lose.</string>
        <string _locid="40960">The Ottomans are so numerous and so wealthy that I see nothing we can do to turn the tide.</string>
        <string _locid="40961">The Turkish empire is tottering. Let us take them down with us! </string>
        <string _locid="40962">The Portuguese have long been my enemies. It seems I cannot hold them off much longer.</string>
        <string _locid="40963">My explorer is back on his feet and ready for action.</string>
        <string _locid="40964">The Portuguese have long been my enemies. Before we give up, let's strike at them - they may prove to be the weak point in our opponents' defenses.</string>
        <string _locid="40965">The Russians are stronger than we. History repeats itself. </string>
        <string _locid="40966">I perceive a weakness in the Russian foe. We may possibly be able to get out of our predicament by focusing on them and knocking them out of the war.</string>
        <string _locid="40967">I am stunned that the Spanish, of all people, are proving the masters.</string>
        <string _locid="40968">The weak opposing Spanish are like an ulcer in our enemy's side. Let us take advantage of their feebleness and destroy them. We may yet win this war.</string>
        <string _locid="40969">We did not defeat them quickly enough. We gave them time to summon reinforcements and that could be our undoing.</string>
        <string _locid="40970">We had the victory won, but now there are more of them. Do you have any reserves you could send?</string>
        <string _locid="40971">It is good that your troops have come to help mine. A little longer and who knows what could have happened? I might even have lost! </string>
        <string _locid="40972">I was worried about the outcome of this fight, but your men seem to have come in time to save my forces! Merci, my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="40973">As I predicted, we are masters in this struggle.</string>
        <string _locid="40975">The enemy has not proven able to cope with us. Now our combined forces will finish him off.</string>
        <string _locid="40976">The enemy's incompetence has led him to this pass. We need only to keep doing what we have been doing so far to let victory fall into our hands.</string>
        <string _locid="40977">The enemy is falling behind me. I wish you would catch up.</string>
        <string _locid="40978">I realize that I could have beaten the enemy by myself, but still there was no need to put it to the test.</string>
        <string _locid="40979">There is still time for you to rally your forces and participate in the final crushing of the foe. Surely you don't want me to have ALL the glory?</string>
        <string _locid="40980">You are doing a terrific job, my friend. I shall strive to live up to your example.</string>
        <string _locid="40981">Move onward to victory! I shall assist you as much as possible! </string>
        <string _locid="40982">Your powerful army and economy have led our alliance to the verge of victory. You are a great leader.</string>
        <string _locid="40983">I had you in the grasp of my hand. Do not think that just because your ally managed to save you THIS time that he will be able to do it EVERY time. </string>
        <string _locid="40984">Seeking refuge under your ally's protective cloak? That won't work forever, you know.</string>
        <string _locid="40985">Hmm. The enemy now has native allies. We shall have to fight all the harder.</string>
        <string _locid="40986">We need to fight natives as well as our main enemy. Keep training that army of yours!</string>
        <string _locid="40987">You clearly do not comprehend the value of combining your forces, and it's going to cost you this fight.</string>
        <string _locid="40988">I could have defeated you alone, but my ally wished to join in the spoils. Too bad for you.</string>
        <string _locid="40989">The fact you have joined up will help you no more than it helped my enemies at Austerlitz. And even better than at Austerlitz, now I have allied troops assisting me.</string>
        <string _locid="40990">You have fallen into our trap! Your armies, grouped together, will now be shattered by OUR armies, grouped together. This will be one of my most glorious triumphs!</string>
        <string _locid="40991">The fools! This enemy town is completely defenseless! Let us take advantage! </string>
        <string _locid="40992">Strike quickly before the enemy realize how vulnerable this town is!</string>
        <string _locid="40993">Our enemy has stuck his neck out - here is a town with no barracks. Send in the cavalry! </string>
        <string _locid="40994">I shall start an offensive at this point.</string>
        <string _locid="40995">He can't reinforce this town with infantry. Take advantage of it!</string>
        <string _locid="40996">Attacking this town with artillery would be easy. He has no stable to produce cavalry.</string>
        <string _locid="40997">I wonder why he has not built a stable near here? Let us take advantage of his oversight at once.</string>
        <string _locid="40998">The enemy has killed my explorer. Perhaps a quick patrol could catch and kill the troops that did this.</string>
        <string _locid="40999">My explorer was overbold and has paid the price.</string>
        <string _locid="41000">My explorer has been slain. Yours must do double duty from now on.</string>
        <string _locid="41002">My explorer lies bleeding his life out, and he was not even taken down by the enemy!</string>
        <string _locid="41003">Now my explorer is hors de combat. This is not an auspicious beginning.</string>
        <string _locid="41004">How pitiable ... calling upon the natives of this land for help.</string>
        <string _locid="41005">The French need this area. So we shall take it.</string>
        <string _locid="41006">This is a terrible place to build a town, as I will soon demonstrate.</string>
        <string _locid="41007">My brilliant scouting techniques have spotted your town's center. Soon the invasion shall begin.</string>
        <string _locid="41008">Towns so near to each other mean you will eat up all the nearby resources all the sooner. </string>
        <string _locid="41009">Your skill in managing your town impresses me. I hope you have not done so too soon.</string>
        <string _locid="41010">You advance with breakneck speed I see. That should give us a tactical edge on our common enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="41011">Excellent, now that you have the technological edge, press your advantage! </string>
        <string _locid="41012">Every time you get a treasure like that, it is good for both of us.</string>
        <string _locid="41013">What do you think you're doing? Shouldn't you be an Age or two higher by now?</string>
        <string _locid="41014">I have been in the next Age for what seems like hours. When will you follow suit?</string>
        <string _locid="41015">When I capture this base, it will unravel the enemy's position.</string>
        <string _locid="41016">I see you run your economy effectively. I am confident you will prove as good at warfare, no?</string>
        <string _locid="41017">That was fast! I suspect it bodes well for the future of our alliance.</string>
        <string _locid="41018">It's about time you managed to reach the Colonial Age with the rest of us.</string>
        <string _locid="41019">Finally! It took you long enough to get here to Colonial.</string>
        <string _locid="41020">I see your colony is still in the early stages of construction. Will you be able to withstand more-advanced enemy armies?</string>
        <string _locid="41021">The enemy will not wait for you to get to Colonial. They'll attack when THEY are ready, not when YOU are ready.</string>
        <string _locid="41022">These discoveries are fascinating. I must make more of them.</string>
        <string _locid="41023">Our scholars in the Sorbonne will welcome the chance to study such things.</string>
        <string _locid="41024">Ah yes, gathering riches will advance our cause.</string>
        <string _locid="41025">You can take that treasure. I wasn't going to get to it until later.</string>
        <string _locid="41026">We should combine our forces to destroy him at this point. I am sending my armies now. </string>
        <string _locid="41027">Please be careful about where you gather your treasures in the future. I will take care of those near my own town.</string>
        <string _locid="41028">Keep up the good work.</string>
        <string _locid="41029">How fine - already gathering your first treasures.</string>
        <string _locid="41030">A fine job in making discoveries. Do not neglect your town's development however.</string>
        <string _locid="41031">It is good to see you have so many treasures. You have not let your economy lag, I trust.</string>
        <string _locid="41032">Can you not find the treasures scattered around the landscape?</string>
        <string _locid="41033">There are treasures here, there, and everywhere. Are you blind?</string>
        <string _locid="41034">I realize this discovery was rather near to your town, but it will go to a good cause.</string>
        <string _locid="41035">Thank you for the treasure!</string>
        <string _locid="41036">You will need to make discoveries on your own for a time I fear. My explorer is indisposed.</string>
        <string _locid="41037">The French tricolor will stand at this point before we are done. Attaque l'outrance! </string>
        <string _locid="41039">I regret to report that my explorer was a bit too bold. He's dead.</string>
        <string _locid="41040">Now my forces are advanced far beyond your primitive imagination.</string>
        <string _locid="41041">You have fallen into my trap - advancing to Colonial too soon!</string>
        <string _locid="41042">Did you wake up at last? Or were you stimulated to Age up by some kind of primeval instinct?</string>
        <string _locid="41043">You are doing well, I see. Please stay in the Discovery Age for as long as possible - preferably the rest of the game.</string>
        <string _locid="41044">You have nothing better to do but look for loot?</string>
        <string _locid="41045">I cannot waste my efforts on picking up random treasures. I have a war to win!</string>
        <string _locid="41046">You must not be very good at multitasking - I see that you have been unable to both gather treasures and try to build your town.</string>
        <string _locid="41047">I think this treasure now belongs to ME.</string>
        <string _locid="41048">By my calculations, the time is ripe to destroy the main enemy town here.</string>
        <string _locid="41049">I regret I do not currently have sufficient resources to help you.</string>
        <string _locid="41050">My resources are almost gone. I cannot do what you've requested.</string>
        <string _locid="41051">My sincerest apologies, but I cannot help at this time.</string>
        <string _locid="41052">I do not have any soldiers yet.</string>
        <string _locid="41053">I am working on other issues at this time, so I do not have an army.</string>
        <string _locid="41054">I have not yet taken the step of creating an army.</string>
        <string _locid="41055">I do not have sufficient men under arms - they would just be killed to no avail.</string>
        <string _locid="41056">My army is not ready to fight.</string>
        <string _locid="41057">My small army would make no difference in the fight. You'll have to do it yourself until I have built up more strength.</string>
        <string _locid="41058">Certainly.</string>
        <string _locid="41059">With the bounty of the New World at my disposal, nothing can stop me</string>
        <string _locid="41060">My men plunder the countryside for my glory. </string>
        <string _locid="41061">Where ever I turn, I find riches to aid the French cause.</string>
        <string _locid="41062">Pathetic ... foraging in the forests like a hungry peasant.</string>
        <string _locid="41063">Grubbing in the dirt again? How sad for you.</string>
        <string _locid="41064">I see your explorer is out frantically accumulating random odds and ends. Your settlers must be very inefficient. </string>
        <string _locid="41065">Already reduced to foraging? Your settlers must be starving.</string>
        <string _locid="41066">Skill in exploration will not help you in the battles to come.</string>
        <string _locid="41067">You have accumulated almost no treasure. I had hoped for a more worthy opponent.</string>
        <string _locid="41068">The foolishness of an inexperienced leader ... wandering so far from reinforcements.</string>
        <string _locid="41069">You'll pay for stealing that treasure. And soon.</string>
        <string _locid="41070">Ha! You fool, can't you even collect the treasure near your own town?</string>
        <string _locid="41071">You STILL have not advanced in Age? The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious for you. </string>
        <string _locid="41072">Advancing at this breakneck speed cannot be good for you in the long run - and that is when I will crush you.</string>
        <string _locid="41073">Finally, signs of life. Perhaps it will at least look like I had a challenge.</string>
        <string _locid="41074">Impressive technology. But can you do anything with it?</string>
        <string _locid="41075">Enjoy your brief edge over me while you can. </string>
        <string _locid="41076">Wasting your resources on bells and whistles I see. Aging up so early is a frivolity I can't afford. </string>
        <string _locid="41078">I have found you! All that remains is to fly a French flag over that town.</string>
        <string _locid="41079">You build near your ally ... a sound strategy. Now I can annihilate you both.</string>
        <string _locid="41080">You build far from your ally's support. Because you are bold? Or simply foolhardy?</string>
        <string _locid="41081">My explorer is free. If you'd paid attention, you could have demanded ransom.</string>
        <string _locid="41082">My explorer has slipped through your clutches. </string>
        <string _locid="41083">Your grip is too weak, my friend. My explorer has escaped.</string>
        <string _locid="41084">I see ... you cannot train troops, so you borrow them.</string>
        <string _locid="41085">I see your puny army. I guess a stealthy approach is beyond your limited capacity.</string>
        <string _locid="41086">Your army is so small and quaint. It almost seems a pity to wreck it.</string>
        <string _locid="41087">A tiny little army. How cute. </string>
        <string _locid="41088">Now that I see your troops, I know what your plan must be. </string>
        <string _locid="41089">Still letting your army wander aimlessly I see. I am sure your men wish they had a more capable commander.</string>
        <string _locid="41090">You have lost the element of surprise. If I were a lesser man, I might even be afraid.</string>
        <string _locid="41091">How ever did YOU come up with an army so large?</string>
        <string _locid="41092">Your army is nowhere near my base. Do you know where you're taking it?</string>
        <string _locid="41093">Worthwhile technique, trying to undercut my economy. More sophisticated than I would have expected from you.</string>
        <string _locid="41094">While you waste precious time chasing down my settlers, my invasion army readies.</string>
        <string _locid="41095">Stop that! Soldiers are meant to fight other soldiers, not civilians.</string>
        <string _locid="41096">You lack finesse, yet you are somehow effective. Perhaps I have underestimated you.</string>
        <string _locid="41097">Sacre bleu! Your forces ... so lethal. I demand a rematch!</string>
        <string _locid="41098">I do not understand what went wrong. My unworthy subordinates must be to blame.</string>
        <string _locid="41099">Another battle, another day without a challenge. (Yawn)</string>
        <string _locid="41100">Vive le empereur! </string>
        <string _locid="41101">Once more French troops under my control prove victorious.</string>
        <string _locid="41102">If you were more cunning, I'd worry about what you're planning.</string>
        <string _locid="41103">Skilled commanders do not give their opponents a chance to rest. Thanks for the respite.</string>
        <string _locid="41104">One misfortune should not make one lose hope.</string>
        <string _locid="41105">If we cannot attack now, then it is indeed over.</string>
        <string _locid="41106">We have persevered this time, my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="41107">I told you that trust in me was well placed.</string>
        <string _locid="41108">Take it from an Ottoman. Artillery is what you need.</string>
        <string _locid="41109">Make falconets ... cannon... any kind of artillery will help you now.</string>
        <string _locid="41110">Cavalry will cut them down like lions among bunnies.</string>
        <string _locid="41111">Train cavalry, my friend. I do it all the time. It is very nice.</string>
        <string _locid="41112">Send in swordsmen or muskets. Anything on two legs.</string>
        <string _locid="41113">We Ottomans have won many battles with infantry. I suggest you try that strategy now.</string>
        <string _locid="41114">The mouse who has only one hole soon gets caught. You should retreat carefully, my Ally.</string>
        <string _locid="41115">No matter how far you have gone down a wrong road, turn back. Retreat and live, my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="41116">The battle you enter will be bloody. I advise caution, my Ally. Even retreat.</string>
        <string _locid="41117">Be careful, the enemy seems an ant, but I see  him an elephant. </string>
        <string _locid="41118">Rethink your fight, my friend, we can discuss plans over cups of frothing ayran.</string>
        <string _locid="41119">When enemies gather like bees to honey victory will be sweet.</string>
        <string _locid="41120">They are afraid of us, see how they rally together.</string>
        <string _locid="41121">I prefer a nice warm bath after winning such an easy battle.</string>
        <string _locid="41122">One does not burn a blanket to get rid of a flea like our enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="41123">We will drink thick boza to toast my victory. You do like chickpeas, yes?</string>
        <string _locid="41124">Another victory for the armies of the Ottoman Empire.</string>
        <string _locid="41125">If a man is judged by his work, I will be a hero when I return home.</string>
        <string _locid="41126">Luck has found me today.</string>
        <string _locid="41127">A hard won victory for our noble Alliance!</string>
        <string _locid="41128">My soldiers fight like lions.</string>
        <string _locid="41130">My armies will be wolves among sheep.</string>
        <string _locid="41131">Perhaps after this battle you would join me for a meal.</string>
        <string _locid="41132">This battle will be good practice for my men.</string>
        <string _locid="41133">I will leave this battle to one of my Viziers.</string>
        <string _locid="41134">Our enemy is a green twig, easily bent ... and broken.</string>
        <string _locid="41135">This battle will be short.</string>
        <string _locid="41136">A heavy stone is not easily moved. Thank you for your aid.</string>
        <string _locid="41137">Reinforcements have turned the tide just as drop by drop, water will make a pond.</string>
        <string _locid="41138">Our enemies gather like buzzing flies!</string>
        <string _locid="41139">Another army joins the battle! They multiply like rabbits!</string>
        <string _locid="41140">I agree. The candle does not give light to itself.</string>
        <string _locid="41141">I will.</string>
        <string _locid="41142">I honor your request.</string>
        <string _locid="41143">To this I agree.</string>
        <string _locid="41144">I am Ottoman. Artillery is my specialty.</string>
        <string _locid="41145">More cannon! More cannon for my good friend!</string>
        <string _locid="41146">Artillery you say? It will be my pleasure!</string>
        <string _locid="41147">I will train cannon and guard them with Hussars.</string>
        <string _locid="41148">I will send janissaries and cannon.</string>
        <string _locid="41149">You will hear the charge of a thousand horses.</string>
        <string _locid="41150">I agree with that assessment. We will train cavalry to use against the enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="41151">Ottomans have strong hussars. We will be glad to bring them to battle.</string>
        <string _locid="41152">I will train hussars and support them with cannon.</string>
        <string _locid="41153">I will train a mixed army -- some horse and some foot.</string>
        <string _locid="41154">We will sharpen our scimitars and polish our muskets and prepare a glorious army of infantry.</string>
        <string _locid="41155">Janissaries it is then!</string>
        <string _locid="41156">My janissaries will enjoy marching into battle.</string>
        <string _locid="41157">Janissaries and artillery. The perfect Ottoman army!</string>
        <string _locid="41158">We will train janissaries and support them with cavalry units.</string>
        <string _locid="41159">Alas, my coffers are empty.</string>
        <string _locid="41160">All that I have would be yours, my friend, if indeed I had anything.</string>
        <string _locid="41161">Although I must suffer in great agony for denying such a noble request I still must do so.</string>
        <string _locid="41162">I am not worthy to be your ally, for I cannot afford your request. I hope someday your children's children can forgive me.</string>
        <string _locid="41163">That would be possible, yet I seem to have spent what little I had.</string>
        <string _locid="41164">You can ask a thousand times, and the answer will still be no.</string>
        <string _locid="41165">Such a thing is impossible.</string>
        <string _locid="41166">Although you deserve much more, such a thing is not to be.</string>
        <string _locid="41167">I would grant you the keys to the gates of paradise if I could, but for now, I can do nothing.</string>
        <string _locid="41168">I know it is your expectation the Ottoman army to be mighty and endless, but sometimes our reputation precedes us and we have not the troops just yet.</string>
        <string _locid="41169">I could send you our finest cooks, tailors and animal handlers, but as for soldiers, we have none.</string>
        <string _locid="41170">We are a long way from the Ottoman Empire, my friend, and I have not the troops to spare.</string>
        <string _locid="41171">If such a thing were possible, but it is not.</string>
        <string _locid="41172">A force greater than both of us prevents that.</string>
        <string _locid="41173">It has been decreed that such a thing is not to be.</string>
        <string _locid="41174">We are but a poor colony with few soldiers.</string>
        <string _locid="41175">I have a janissary or two, but not enough to be of assistance.</string>
        <string _locid="41176">My troops are dining at the moment. I cannot spare them.</string>
        <string _locid="41177">We were so close to victory, my friend. Perhaps we should try again.</string>
        <string _locid="41178">They destroyed one of our trading posts and stole our well-deserved victory away.</string>
        <string _locid="41179">The British are very weak.</string>
        <string _locid="41180">The Dutch will resign soon.</string>
        <string _locid="41181">The French will surrender. They often do.</string>
        <string _locid="41182">I have fought Germans many times, so I know they will soon resign.</string>
        <string _locid="41183">There is only room for one Ottoman colony. And it will be mine.</string>
        <string _locid="41184">We will drive them back to Portugal!</string>
        <string _locid="41185">These Russians will not be a threat much longer.</string>
        <string _locid="41186">Remember back when the Spanish were actually dangerous?</string>
        <string _locid="41187">The British army is quite strong.</string>
        <string _locid="41188">I do not know how they do it, but the Dutch are a big threat.</string>
        <string _locid="41189">France often has a huge army and I fear this time is no exception.</string>
        <string _locid="41190">I have fought Germans many times. They can be quite dangerous.</string>
        <string _locid="41191">It appears I have a rival for control of the Ottoman Empire.</string>
        <string _locid="41192">Keep your eye on the Portuguese. They are our biggest threat.</string>
        <string _locid="41193">Russians like to attack early. Be prepared.</string>
        <string _locid="41194">These Spanish often have strong infantry and cavalry.</string>
        <string _locid="41195">You advance quickly. That is good, but do not over extend yourself.</string>
        <string _locid="41196">I have seen birds that do not fly as fast as you. I hope you did not advance too early.</string>
        <string _locid="41197">You must have resources coming in quickly to be able to go up before me. Let us use that to our advantage.</string>
        <string _locid="41198">Our enemy is forging alliances with the local people.</string>
        <string _locid="41199">Did you see that? Our enemy has allied with another native American.</string>
        <string _locid="41200">Our enemy appears to be going for a native American strategy.</string>
        <string _locid="41201">Let our enemy forge alliances. It will come to naught in the end.</string>
        <string _locid="41202">You need to advance in Age if you are to have a military.</string>
        <string _locid="41203">Is this some secret strategy, my friend, or have hard times fallen upon you?</string>
        <string _locid="41204">Staying in an early Age for so long can be dangerous ...</string>
        <string _locid="41205">Are you behind, my friend? How can I help?</string>
        <string _locid="41206">Have faith, my ally. Though you are behind, it is not too late to advance to the next Age.</string>
        <string _locid="41207">He who asks advice passes the mountain; he who does not loses his way on the level plain. Do you need aid?</string>
        <string _locid="41208">We are allies, it is no shame to ask for help.</string>
        <string _locid="41209">Do you need coin or food to advance in Age? I will share if I can.</string>
        <string _locid="41210">You have beaten our enemy to the second Age!</string>
        <string _locid="41211">If skills could be learned by watching, every dog would be a butcher and we would all advance in Age with you.</string>
        <string _locid="41212">Activity breeds prosperity.</string>
        <string _locid="41213">One day share with me the secret of your speed.</string>
        <string _locid="41214">Our enemies will eat the dust kicked up by your progress.</string>
        <string _locid="41215">With patience mulberry leaves become satin. I am sure you are weaving very fine cloth.</string>
        <string _locid="41216">A horse ridden slowly reaches its destination, my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="41217">The enemy rushes forward blindly in haste. You are patient and wise.</string>
        <string _locid="41218">Silks made slowly, wear longest.</string>
        <string _locid="41219">We harvest what we sow. You have sown patience, we will harvest victory.</string>
        <string _locid="41220">My explorer is rescued. You have the gratitude of the Ottoman Empire.</string>
        <string _locid="41221">My explorer is on his feet. I will send word of your deeds to his family.</string>
        <string _locid="41222">You have rescued my explorer and saved me coin! I am truly grateful.</string>
        <string _locid="41223">My explorer, you saved him. I hope that he may be of service to you soon.</string>
        <string _locid="41224">The family of my explorer sends their gratitude for his rescue.</string>
        <string _locid="41225">My faithful explorer is rescued. Hopefully he will be more cautious in the future.</string>
        <string _locid="41226">I have saved us from the lion's jaws!</string>
        <string _locid="41227">I have stopped the timer! We must take advantage of this opportunity.</string>
        <string _locid="41228">Our enemies will barter with these natives no more.</string>
        <string _locid="41229">These natives may wish to barter with us now.</string>
        <string _locid="41230">Our enemy's alliance with these natives is broken.</string>
        <string _locid="41231">These natives may wish to ally with the Ottomans now.</string>
        <string _locid="41232">Again, I have conquered our enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="41233">I have brought falling embers to our enemy's colony.</string>
        <string _locid="41234">Our enemy's colony sheds embers into the darkening sky.</string>
        <string _locid="41235">The cries and smoke are thick in our enemy's colony.</string>
        <string _locid="41236">White clothes become dirty. Our enemy's colony is no more.</string>
        <string _locid="41237">Our enemy will not grow fat from this trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="41238">The enemy controls this trading post no longer.</string>
        <string _locid="41239">This trading post is dead to me.</string>
        <string _locid="41240">I have destroyed an enemy trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="41241">Our enemy's trading post is burnt to the ground.</string>
        <string _locid="41242">The enemy's alliance with this tribe is sound, I will have to try again.</string>
        <string _locid="41243">Our enemy's alliance with this tribe is as thick as marble.</string>
        <string _locid="41244">I did not expect their buildings to be so well constructed ...</string>
        <string _locid="41245">The enemy colony still stands ... for now.</string>
        <string _locid="41246">I underestimated their preparedness. It will not happen again, my Ally.</string>
        <string _locid="41247">My most sincere apologies, ally. I did not destroy the trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="41248">You must excuse me, my ally, my explorer has fallen and I must prepare his family for the news.</string>
        <string _locid="41249">This New World is full of evil beasts with sharp teeth, some of which have claimed my explorer.</string>
        <string _locid="41250">There is little to gain from further conflict.</string>
        <string _locid="41251">I am fighting our enemy here - rally your soldiers to the banner of Suleiman the Magnificent!</string>
        <string _locid="41252">My colony is overrun!</string>
        <string _locid="41253">The enemy swarms my colony like fleas on a camel!</string>
        <string _locid="41254">I am besieged! At meal time! Our enemy is less than a dog.</string>
        <string _locid="41255">I am Suleiman the Magnificent. Perhaps you have heard of me?</string>
        <string _locid="41256">I am Suleiman the Magnificent. I toast the beginning of our alliance with warm boza!</string>
        <string _locid="41257">I am Suleiman the Magnificent. I AM the Ottoman Empire.</string>
        <string _locid="41258">Our engagements grow more and more challenging. I trust you are ready.</string>
        <string _locid="41259">You are wise to choose your battles carefully. A stair is climbed step by step.</string>
        <string _locid="41260">He who was once my enemy is now my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="41261">Greetings again. Perhaps this time I will keep up with you.</string>
        <string _locid="41262">So I defeated you before, and now you come to me as an ally? So be it. I shall not turn you away.</string>
        <string _locid="41263">I hope that you learned from me during our last encounter.</string>
        <string _locid="41264">Be strong this time. One crow does not make winter.</string>
        <string _locid="41265">You like to fight on this map, yes?</string>
        <string _locid="41266">This time we shall win. Patience is the key to paradise.</string>
        <string _locid="41267">So, shall we drive them before us once more?</string>
        <string _locid="41268">Once a friend, always a friend. We will be victorious again.</string>
        <string _locid="41269">My explorer is restored to me, his family has sent ransom in cattle and silks.</string>
        <string _locid="41270">Good. My explorer can now resume humble service to Suleiman the Magnificent.</string>
        <string _locid="41271">Our mutual enemy's town appears defenseless.</string>
        <string _locid="41272">It seems our enemy's colony is undefended.</string>
        <string _locid="41273">Our enemy appears to have no infantry. Perhaps we should strike.</string>
        <string _locid="41274">I have seen the enemy town and did not see a barracks. We should not expect an army of infantry.</string>
        <string _locid="41275">My scouts report that our enemy is not training cavalry.</string>
        <string _locid="41276">Ottoman scouts report that there is no stable in our enemy's colony.</string>
        <string _locid="41277">Ottomans always have coin to spare.</string>
        <string _locid="41278">I will share my wealth.</string>
        <string _locid="41279">The generosity of the Ottoman Empire is legendary. Have some coin.</string>
        <string _locid="41280">I was going to commission a new saddle for my horse, but perhaps this coin is better spent on you instead.</string>
        <string _locid="41281">You can never say that Suleiman never gave you anything.</string>
        <string _locid="41282">He who has no bread has no authority.</string>
        <string _locid="41283">A person cannot fight on an empty stomach.</string>
        <string _locid="41284">Janissaries are famous for their cooking. Perhaps you'd like a taste?</string>
        <string _locid="41285">Olives from the Mediterranean. Dates from Mesopotamia. All for you to sample.</string>
        <string _locid="41286">Janissaries never march to war without their soup pots. Perhaps you'd like to share?</string>
        <string _locid="41287">This lumber came all the way from Asia.</string>
        <string _locid="41288">Wood. Wood for buildings, for ships, and for artillery.</string>
        <string _locid="41289">Here, my friend. Use this wood for the glory of both our nations.</string>
        <string _locid="41290">To celebrate our alliance, I have sent you a gift of fine lumber.</string>
        <string _locid="41291">I was going to cast this away, seeing how flush with resources my colonies are, but perhaps you can make use of this wood.</string>
        <string _locid="41292">Prepare to witness my magnificent attack upon our unsuspecting enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="41293">Like a wind across the desert, my forces ride towards the enemy colony.</string>
        <string _locid="41294">We will fall upon the enemy colony like lions at the feast.</string>
        <string _locid="41295">Study this colony well. In a moment there will be nothing left.</string>
        <string _locid="41296">Now you will see the full might of the Ottoman Empire as we raze this town.</string>
        <string _locid="41297">Now you will watch as the little people flee before me!</string>
        <string _locid="41298">If you see smoke on the horizon, it is my army in our enemy's town.</string>
        <string _locid="41299">My soldiers rally under the crescent banner. We march!</string>
        <string _locid="41300">Our enemy has forged an alliance with the natives here. It will not last.</string>
        <string _locid="41301">He who has no bread has no authority. I go to take the bread from our enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="41302">My soldiers march to join yours, my ally.</string>
        <string _locid="41303">Guests bring good luck - I will join you in your attack.</string>
        <string _locid="41304">A wise man remembers his friends at all times. I am sending soldiers with you.</string>
        <string _locid="41305">I am building a new camp to train soldiers.</string>
        <string _locid="41306">The Ottomans claim this territory for our next colony.</string>
        <string _locid="41307">Soon this land too will experience the bounty of the Ottoman Empire.</string>
        <string _locid="41308">Suleiman the Magnificent claims this land for a new colony.</string>
        <string _locid="41309">I am going to convince these native Americans to form an alliance.</string>
        <string _locid="41310">A thousand friends are too few. I will try to ally with the native Americans here.</string>
        <string _locid="41311">We need more trade. I will start with this site.</string>
        <string _locid="41312">Coffee and silk will bring great wealth in these lands. I will build a trading post.</string>
        <string _locid="41313">This building shall not fall.</string>
        <string _locid="41314">I will not let this building fall while my soldiers have breath.</string>
        <string _locid="41315">I will make my stand here.</string>
        <string _locid="41316">I will hold this ground until star and moon fall.</string>
        <string _locid="41317">I will defend our alliance with the native Americans.</string>
        <string _locid="41318">I am sending soldiers to protect our alliance with the native Americans.</string>
        <string _locid="41319">My soldiers will defend this town through a thousand winters.</string>
        <string _locid="41320">This town will not fall to our enemy.</string>
        <string _locid="41321">I will defend the Trade Route. One who handles honey licks his fingers.</string>
        <string _locid="41322">Gold does not rust on the ground, but this trading post will not defend itself.</string>
        <string _locid="41323">I will share the wealth of my empire by sending you coin.</string>
        <string _locid="41324">When my coffers overflow, I will send extra coin to you.</string>
        <string _locid="41325">My silos are full. I can send you Food.</string>
        <string _locid="41326">A red apple invites stones, but I will continue to share my Food with you.</string>
        <string _locid="41327">If you can still use wood, I will continue to send it.</string>
        <string _locid="41328">Our buildings are of stone and plaster, I will send you wood that we do not use.</string>
        <string _locid="41329">I am on my way. Hold as long as you can!</string>
        <string _locid="41330">My soldiers rally to your flag!</string>
        <string _locid="41331">The armies of Suleiman the Magnificent will arrive soon.</string>
        <string _locid="41332">My people say if you have never been sun burned, you will never know a shadow's value.</string>
        <string _locid="41333">My people say listen a hundred times; ponder a thousand times; speak once.</string>
        <string _locid="41334">My people say two watermelons cannot be held under one arm.</string>
        <string _locid="41335">My people say coffee should be strong as death, sweet as love, and black as hell.</string>
        <string _locid="41336">My people say the plumber's house always leaks.</string>
        <string _locid="41337">My people say you will reach for a snake if you fall into the sea.</string>
        <string _locid="41338">My people say do not search for a calf under the ox.</string>
        <string _locid="41339">A wise man remembers his friends at all times; a fool, only when he has need of them.</string>
        <string _locid="41340">Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit.</string>
        <string _locid="41341">My people say no one gives alms to a closed palm. Do you need anything?</string>
        <string _locid="41342">If you trust me as an ally, you will send me coin.</string>
        <string _locid="41343">Can you spare coin? It will be a good investment.</string>
        <string _locid="41344">Do you have Food you can spare?</string>
        <string _locid="41345">An open mouth remains not hungry. I need Food, my ally.</string>
        <string _locid="41346">Send me wood, my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="41347">My colony grows. Can you spare some wood?</string>
        <string _locid="41348">The sight of your army makes me smile, friend.</string>
        <string _locid="41349">I shall treat your army to a feast when we are done!</string>
        <string _locid="41350">Your soldiers are a welcome sight!</string>
        <string _locid="41351">I can use that coin. My thanks.</string>
        <string _locid="41352">We shall put this Food to good use.</string>
        <string _locid="41353">My thanks for your assistance. It takes two hands to make a sound.</string>
        <string _locid="41354">I, Suleiman the Magnificent, thank you.</string>
        <string _locid="41355">The Ottoman Empire thanks you.</string>
        <string _locid="41356">I will spend any resources you can send to me.</string>
        <string _locid="41357">Ah, more wood. Excellent.</string>
        <string _locid="41358">The British are cunning and their armies are well-equipped. It does not look good for us.</string>
        <string _locid="41359">The Dutch know more of warfare than I expected. The outlook is grim.</string>
        <string _locid="41360">The French are as dangerous as I feared. We fight a losing fight.</string>
        <string _locid="41361">The Germans are a relentless enemy. We are losing ground.</string>
        <string _locid="41362">It is not surprising that one of my countrymen is a match for both of us. </string>
        <string _locid="41363">The Portuguese are endlessly resourceful. This is a dark day.</string>
        <string _locid="41364">Is there nothing we can do to turn the Russian tide?</string>
        <string _locid="41365">The Spanish stand poised to crush us. We only have to wait.</string>
        <string _locid="41366">My children's grandchildren will be shamed by losing to the British.</string>
        <string _locid="41367">Despite their inferior troops, the Dutch continue to defeat us.</string>
        <string _locid="41368">It is humiliating that we are losing to the French.</string>
        <string _locid="41369">If we lose to the Germans, I will never be considered fit to lead in battle again.</string>
        <string _locid="41370">I cannot stand to lose to this traitorous Ottoman commander.</string>
        <string _locid="41371">I cannot believe you allowed the Portuguese to beat us.</string>
        <string _locid="41372">The Russians swarm like ants ... and we let them.</string>
        <string _locid="41373">I do not know how I allowed the Spanish to beat us.</string>
        <string _locid="41374">We sprinkle blood on a dying tree. Blood I can spare no longer.</string>
        <string _locid="41375">My armies have fought like lions to protect our colonies, but it is not enough.</string>
        <string _locid="41376">A white day sheds light, a black day sheds darkness. This is a white day.</string>
        <string _locid="41377">You do well, my ally. A lion sleeps in the heart of every brave man.</string>
        <string _locid="41378">Though I am the stronger, I know you will still contribute to this alliance.</string>
        <string _locid="41379">We fought valiantly, but the time has come to resign.</string>
        <string _locid="41380">A white day sheds light, a black day sheds darkness. This is a black day.</string>
        <string _locid="41381">Every sheep is hung by his own leg, I fear we head toward slaughter.</string>
        <string _locid="41382">We cannot win this. Empty words will not fill an empty stomach.</string>
        <string _locid="41383">Even the highest tree has an axe waiting at its foot. We are finished.</string>
        <string _locid="41384">Either drive this camel to pasture or leave the country - we are done here!</string>
        <string _locid="41385">It is easier to teach a camel to jump than to convince you to resign!</string>
        <string _locid="41386">We should have known they would try to win this way.</string>
        <string _locid="41387">Our enemy has established an alliance with some of the native Americans here. We should pursue our own alliances. </string>
        <string _locid="41388">Our enemy is swift or we are slow. We should build our own trading posts. Or destroy his.</string>
        <string _locid="41389">The native Americans have found a strong ally in you.</string>
        <string _locid="41390">And in another thing you are the first.</string>
        <string _locid="41391">It is wise to establish trade while others only consider it.</string>
        <string _locid="41392">Your explorer has keen eyes!</string>
        <string _locid="41393">Excellent! Your discovery will speed our victory!</string>
        <string _locid="41394">I'm sure that will fetch a fine price at the bazaar, my friend.</string>
        <string _locid="41395">It is a fine explorer that feeds his people. But beware the choke-cherries.</string>
        <string _locid="41396">My explorer is more diplomat than outdoorsman, I would be honored if your explorer tutored him.</string>
        <string _locid="41397">Take it. My people say, 'Let your neighbor be well off, for then he will not ask you for anything.'</string>
        <string _locid="41398">A native American warrior will be a great aid to you.</string>
        <string _locid="41399">Your compassion for the helpless will return to us in time.</string>
        <string _locid="41400">Your explorer has a good eye for the exotic woods found here.</string>
        <string _locid="41401">Your alliances with the native people will serve us well.</string>
        <string _locid="41402">Eat and drink with your friends, but do not trade with them. Present company excluded, of course.</string>
        <string _locid="41403">I have this advice for your walls -- measure a thousand times; cut once.</string>
        <string _locid="41404">Remember, small keys unlock big doors. And cannon. Cannon work also.</string>
        <string _locid="41405">My emissaries have secured the first alliance with the native Americans.</string>
        <string _locid="41406">This land is in need of dates and silks. I will sell Ottoman luxuries in the wilderness.</string>
        <string _locid="41407">This land is vast and full of wonders.</string>
        <string _locid="41408">Hmm ... this New World could prove lucrative after all. </string>
        <string _locid="41409">Exotic Food for my new colony. Did I warn you about choke-cherries?</string>
        <string _locid="41410">My apologies. This explorer is young and eager. He will not gather treasures on your doorstep again.</string>
        <string _locid="41411">My explorer is swift and keen-eyed. But I'm sure there are still treasures for you to claim.</string>
        <string _locid="41412">A native American warrior. He will be a great help to my efforts. </string>
        <string _locid="41413">There is much to learn, but each settler builds a piece of the Ottoman Empire.</string>
        <string _locid="41414">There is little wood in our architecture; still, this wood is useful.</string>
        <string _locid="41415">The sincerity of my words draws more allies to our alliance.</string>
        <string _locid="41416">Our enemy has glutted the markets with baubles and trash. Now all will see superior Ottoman goods.</string>
        <string _locid="41417">I am building a wall around my colony. An open door is an invitation to the viper.</string>
        <string _locid="41418">A red apple invites stones. Our prosperity will make us a target. We must prepare.</string>
        <string _locid="41419">Sorrow is to the soul what the worm is to wood. Do not let your losses eat at you.</string>
        <string _locid="41420">Stairs are climbed step by step. Though you appear to have leapt them two by two.</string>
        <string _locid="41421">You have seen many battles since we last met. Let us win this one together.</string>
        <string _locid="41422">There is still time for me to pull victory from the lion's mouth.</string>
        <string _locid="41423">We persevered, and so we shall be rewarded.</string>
        <string _locid="41424">It is the aunt or uncle of all battles!</string>
        <string _locid="41425">No matter how tall a tree grows its leaves always fall to the ground.</string>
        <string _locid="41426">A dog that intends to bite does not bare its teeth. I will remember this for next time.</string>
        <string _locid="41427">It is more difficult to contend with oneself than the world. This defeat is my own.</string>
        <string _locid="41428">You are a worthy enemy. I will stop underestimating you.</string>
        <string _locid="41429">You turned my attacks as the moon turns the tide. I must rethink my strategy.</string>
        <string _locid="41430">I have learned from this battle. Do not expect that you will win another.</string>
        <string _locid="41431">You have won a great victory, but as rain does not soak marble, you will not defeat me.</string>
        <string _locid="41432">Bah ... I would have won that engagement, but you made me spill coffee on my robes.</string>
        <string _locid="41433">You lose. A donkey is a donkey even when he is finely saddled.</string>
        <string _locid="41434">Try not to get too much blood on my robes. They are Oriental silk. Very expensive.</string>
        <string _locid="41435">If anyone weeps for you, it will be your mother; others will only pretend to weep.</string>
        <string _locid="41436">A man becomes experienced by being defeated; a scholar, by making mistakes. I think you must be very learned.</string>
        <string _locid="41437">Beauty passes, wisdom remains. You must be very wise to have stolen victory from me.</string>
        <string _locid="41438">He who would gather honey must bear the sting of bees.</string>
        <string _locid="41439">Your soldiers are in disarray. Their leader sounds an uncertain trumpet.</string>
        <string _locid="41440">Sorrow is to the soul what the worm is to wood.</string>
        <string _locid="41441">The battle is turning. The cock that crows too early gets his head cut off.</string>
        <string _locid="41442">Only your ally saved you this time. Next time you will not be so fortunate.</string>
        <string _locid="41443">You Age up quickly, but every man has his own way of eating yogurt.</string>
        <string _locid="41444">What flares up fast, extinguishes soon.</string>
        <string _locid="41445">Your Native Allies will make no difference in the end.</string>
        <string _locid="41446">If you have something to say to me, say it in my town and leave my allies out of this.</string>
        <string _locid="41447">You will pay for what you have done.</string>
        <string _locid="41448">Relish your victory, but know that the liar's candle will only last until evening.</string>
        <string _locid="41449">Yet once again we see that beauty passes. Wisdom remains.</string>
        <string _locid="41450">You grow lethargic in the first Age. For the lean ox, there is no knife.</string>
        <string _locid="41451">Are you still competing, or have you gone off to compose music?</string>
        <string _locid="41452">To the snake that does not bite me, may he live a thousand years. </string>
        <string _locid="41453">Do not roll up your trousers before reaching the stream.</string>
        <string _locid="41454">The fly in a hurry falls into the milk.</string>
        <string _locid="41455">Oh, I forgot about you. Are you still in this fight?</string>
        <string _locid="41456">Two camels fight and the fly in between dies. You will be crushed.</string>
        <string _locid="41457">You are miles away from your ally. You have no hope.</string>
        <string _locid="41458">You are alone ... a sheep separated from the flock.</string>
        <string _locid="41459">You huddle together like baby chickens!</string>
        <string _locid="41460">That is quite enough of that!</string>
        <string _locid="41461">This too shall be mine.</string>
        <string _locid="41462">Suleiman the Magnificent pronounces this colony unfit. Resign now, and you may leave in peace.</string>
        <string _locid="41463">This building offended me, so I have destroyed it.</string>
        <string _locid="41464">Watch your tongue when you speak to me. Sharp vinegar only damages its container.</string>
        <string _locid="41465">You will harvest what you sow.</string>
        <string _locid="41466">The fly is small, but it can upset your stomach.</string>
        <string _locid="41467">There is no rose without a thorn, nor contest without a rival.</string>
        <string _locid="41468">A weapon is an enemy, even to its owner.</string>
        <string _locid="41469">A thousand friends are too few; one enemy is too many. You will learn the truth of this soon.</string>
        <string _locid="41470">I see you enjoy a challenge. Then I shall give you one.</string>
        <string _locid="41471">Yes, I was too much for you last battle. I will go easier on you this time.</string>
        <string _locid="41472">Very well, we shall try again.</string>
        <string _locid="41473">You bit off more bread than you could swallow last time. Perhaps this time will go better for you.</string>
        <string _locid="41474">You leap into a sea full of sharks!</string>
        <string _locid="41475">A daring rescue that will be the subject of a hundred poems.</string>
        <string _locid="41476">I have looked into the eyes of my enemy and I do not like what I see there.</string>
        <string _locid="41477">I see your soldiers. Do not think they are hiding.</string>
        <string _locid="41478">Is this a raid? Are you sure you are ready? I will not go easy on you.</string>
        <string _locid="41479">The hare was angry at the mountain, but the mountain was unaware of it. Your army is meaningless.</string>
        <string _locid="41480">You prey on those who cannot defend themselves. There is no honor in that.</string>
        <string _locid="41481">An army that size ... I suspect they do not bring tidings of your imminent surrender.</string>
        <string _locid="41482">In case your runners have been lost. Your army has strayed into my territory. I would advise you to withdraw.</string>
        <string _locid="41483">Suleiman the Magnificent will not forget how you attacked this colony.</string>
        <string _locid="41484">Ah ... a scouting party. A wise man speaks of what he sees.</string>
        <string _locid="41485">There is no need for a guide to a village which is visible.</string>
        <string _locid="41486">I see your colony, there. I told my cartographers not to bother adding it to their map.</string>
        <string _locid="41487">A bird steals bread from beneath the nose of the unwary.</string>
        <string _locid="41488">Better to die on an empty stomach than live on an empty one. You have eaten, yes?</string>
        <string _locid="41489">A single misfortune is better than a thousand warnings!</string>
        <string _locid="41490">A good man will appear when talked about. You must have said my name.</string>
        <string _locid="41491">He who steals a minaret prepares a case for it.</string>
        <string _locid="41492">When you are an anvil, be patient; when you are a hammer, be strong.</string>
        <string _locid="41493">A carefree head is only found on a scarecrow.</string>
        <string _locid="41494">I admit defeat. Will you accept my surrender?</string>
        <string _locid="41498">I have struggled against you long enough. Shall we call this finished?</string>
        <string _locid="41500">Enough! You have won. I will resign if you will permit me.</string>
        <string _locid="41502">Thorns and roses grow on the same tree. The rose you have found will soon show you its thorns.</string>
        <string _locid="41503">Do not think Suleiman is blind to the tendrils you spread across the New World.</string>
        <string _locid="41504">Your explorer is eager. He better watch out for bears. And janissaries.</string>
        <string _locid="41505">I am sure news of your discovery will make all the effort worthwhile.</string>

She makes full use of the versatility of the Spanish army, but never leaves her colonies undefended. She is unlikely to take dangerous risks.</string>
        <string _locid="41719">Ivan the Terrible is ruthless, sinister and threatening. He taunts enemy and ally alike. He likes to attack early and swarm his opponents with infantry and emphasizes large armies at the expense of technological development.</string>
        <string _locid="41720">Maurice of Orange is all business. Every conversation is a transaction and every decision revolves around profit. He views war as a necessary part of business. He looks for Trade Routes when possible, but always defends his colonies.</string>
        <string _locid="41721">Henry the Navigator is calculating and far-sighted. He emphasizes exploration and economic development over military dominance. He can take offense easily and can be something of a zealot when dealing with non-Portuguese.</string>
        <string _locid="41722">Frederick the Great is proud and confident. He expresses regret when his men die in battle, but does not hesitate to use his entire military might to accomplish even the smallest task. Frederick will not neglect his economy, but believes in attacking aggressively. </string>
        <string _locid="41723">Suleiman the Magnificent is scholarly and even-tempered. He balances colony development, trade, improvements and military. He is gracious to allies but may underestimate opponents.</string>
